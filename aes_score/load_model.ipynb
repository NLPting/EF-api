    "'Robots in my country By now , there are no intelligent service robots in the households . Though , on the other hand , most electric devices contains some kind of a microprocessor that makes them intelligent in some kind of way . In my opinion these are the precursor of those service robots . Nevertheless , the influence of those robots is quite difference . For the good they are simplifying the life a lot allowing the user a broad range of functions by just pushing some buttons . But the negative aspect of robots is the dependency of human life on robots as well as electric power . Considering the problems during a blackout must result in the opinion that robots are defining our daily life . And this conclusion can be emphasized by looking at the development of work conditions . Where once have been manufactures now there are assembly lines where most of the work is done by robots . This lead to the loss of many jobs . So to put all in a nutshell the future of robots and with robots has a great potential but also contains a great dependency and can result in negative effects .'\n",
