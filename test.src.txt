The Theft only was discover next day . In order to replace the cup , the Brazilian Federation made a replica . Thieves are never benn catched .
I like Chine , England , France etc . . . Paris is my favorite city , it 's absolutely beautiful and foods are amazing . Tokyo is moderm , London is cooled .. I have not been to China yet , but.

The Crime of Mossor Mossoro is a great city , but , the increasing of crime is the biggest worry of people . In last week seven people was killed and more twenty people was stolen . Live in my city today is not good . The number of policies is not sufficient for stop the kind of crimes . So. I guess. Iwill just to Mossoro when there peace . God bless everybody . Isaac

. I Hiro Takashi and his team are working on a project which has as objective to develop an escort robot . Hiro 's and his team have already developed some robots with ability to display some emotional intelligence . Hiro show us how far the technology goes today . By the time when his teacher graduated , the first mobile robot was of size of several people , it took few minutes to walk a few feet and it was controlled by a huge computer . They will work on this project <num> years and as future developments they hope it will look more humanoid . Florence , a dedicated service robot , works in the health field . Measuring only two foot tall , Florence is capable to pick up the trash and help with work security . The next phase of robot 's development , they will be working on programming it to visit quarantined patients with contagious diseases . Major Pettigrew is working on a soccer player robot . Shaping as a dog , by <num> the robot will be so intelligent so that it will be capable to play against of human soccer player.
I consider myself a lucky person , because. I realized in time that the good life and live it in the true sense of the word . So , after following the canons of stressed life made ? ? of a steady pace , slowly. I gained consciousness of having to settle in and set me to change the scale of values . No more work in the first place but family , health , work . We all need to work on , but very often a lot of work removing time to family and health to afford the unnecessary . To understand where this infernal mechanism , it 's easy to invert the scale . From there. I started to love my mountains. I left the house , to reach them with long and fatiguing walk up to the top . A snack of genuine products , in the simplicity of a mountain retreat . Go to bed early and get up early , to be sure. I do my job with passion and professionalism , but when. I go to the mountains or in the evening. I can Switch off my phone , this is a luxury that. I can afford today .
The use of robots has increased dramatically in the last years in Germany . The robots are used especially for the control of production processes in the metal and car industry . But also in the medical field , the use of robots has increased greatly . Here in Germany , more than <num> surgeries with the help of robots are performed per year . Robots are used for dangerous work processes ( defusing bombs and grenades ) and robots are also used in the space research ( satellite ) , marine research ( remote - controlled submarines ) , in the army ( so - called drones ) and even in the household ( vacuum cleaner and lawnmower ) . Many people say that robots are a boon to mankind . This is basically correct . Thus , for example , the productivity ( the ratio between input and output ) has improved significantly in the industrial sector and the very heavy and dangerous work have been greatly reduced . But it must not be overlooked that the use of robots also poses significant disadvantages . On the one hand , the workers do not participate adequately in the productivity improvement . On the other hand , many thousands jobs get lost . The loss of jobs is a serious socio - political problem , because the number of unemployed increases and that includes a lot of social dynamite.
I am applying for a bank loan . Let me see what. I need . I need to proof my identity which. I can do with my driver 's license as. I lost my identity card . Out of the driver 's license they can take my date of birth and residence . Further more the bank needs a proof of employment . I have not done any photocopy of the last three month pay slips . Well ,. I will do it tomorrow . The pay slip is not only the proof of my employment but also shows how much. I earn . I have to bear in mind that bank statements are examined for many different factors that may be relevant to my ability to make repayments , such as the level of activity and average of bank balance . So. I will also make a copy of the account statements in order to show that have no further debts . The last point of my to do list is to make my mind up , what kind of loan. I want .
There are three kinds of robots described in the web - page magazine , and they come from three differents fields of the human experience . The first is related with emotional inteligence . They are trying to give some kind of emotion and feeling to these generation of robots . They already have artificial inteligence , but they can not yet feel like a human being . Emotions like sorry , fear , happy or saddiness , will be the next step in this field . One another kind of robots come from the African Continent . They are using robots in the medical and health field . These robots are programed to visit patients and talk to them . The next step will be program them to visit patients with contagious deseases in order to take care of them . Robots are present too in the sport field too . There are even competition between robots , where they really play a sport , and score a gol . The next step will be program them to play with real humans .
Robot is newly forming in our lives , and its uncommon to most people in Jordan until now , but it is well - known to a lot in Medical sector , and Jordan is the first country in the Arabian region plus Middle East and the seventh country in the world that entered robots technology for treating Parkinsons disease in Jordan Hospital , in addition they might be using to treat another diseases in the future . Industrial sector in Jordan is nt developed yet to use robots in their companies , like the advanced countries which using robots in assembly - line jobs that increase their productivity with less costs , as a result could get a lot of profits it is related that they do nt need to hire number of workforce just they need the people with higher - level skills to accomplish tasks that robots could nt do until now . So. I feel sorry with the poor and middle - level people because if robots would replace humans they might be losing their jobs and worrying about their life . Although. I optimistic of robots on the other hand. I feel pessimistic and worried from the technology in the future , is it changes our life to better or worse who knows? Could you imagine the robots replace the humans ? Really. I do nt think that , its unbelievable .
It 's been a long time since men walked on earth . Obviously , the men we refer to today differs considerably from our antecedents . Such evolution means we can not remain the same . As time went by , mankind ascertained they could create things which might be useful or even replace them : robots . Year after year many more are produced so as to perform what men do not want to or to perfect what a human being might do , however , not in a fast or pristine way . The task we have just listened to shows three accounts on how robots have been perfected and can go beyond what 's ever been thought of . The first one reports a very particular robot which allegedly displays facial expressions likening humans . The second one is programmed to do simple tasks like throwing the trash away , though , in ten years ' time it might well visit quarantine patients , which would be not only safe , but also practical either to medical staff and families . The third on , very riveting , is a pet dog robot . Although it seems to be a simple thing , it 's a huge step toward evolution.
In my city , Munich , we have a large car company , BMW . They are the largest employer in the city . They have modern assembly lines , for all kinds of work , which are done by robots . A lot of that work would be dangerous for humans . For them , times of assembly lines had long gone . Researchers had found out , that their productivity is far better , when they work in small teams on the whole car . Humans are not good at working alone , and do the same thing hundreds of times a day . They are more motivated and produce better results , when they work in a group on a more demanding task . In hospitals , robots are used when an operation needs to be done extremely precisly . Which means , that 1/100 millimeter counts . For example , by heart surgeries . These robots are on the cutting edge and very expensive . In Munich we have only two hospitals , which can afford them . In the food processing , nearly everthing is done by robots . Their work is not very complicated and so they are affordable for all larger food companies .
In Brazil , we have two ways to have a home loan . First , if you have money , it is more easily because you donot have to fill out a lot of forms . Just go to a local bank and say if you want buy a house . They would check your baking account and go to do a check out into a house . If the house is ok , they give you a home loan and a planning to pay back the loan . But if you donot have money , you would take a home loan with a goverment program call " My House , My Life " . This program have a lot of forms to fill out and it is very difficult all the process . They check all yours identiffies and if have all the information , you need to wait the goverment call you to finalized the process and finally , get the home loan . So , if you have the money , is very easy but if you donot , you have to be pacient and very calm .
I lie down on the beach , hearing the sound of water lapping on the shore .. I let the sand massage my hands ,. I feel so refreshing .. I feel like taking a holiday in the Hawaii ,. I feel the breeze hug me softly , it gave me a sense of soothing . I gaze up the starry sky ,. I seemingly see the stars are smiling at me , and then. I count the stars , one , two , three , gradually. I drift off .
Attending the Star Attack seminar , it is for me an easy issue to have to choose one of three celebrities . My favorite celebrity is definitely Jacqueline Brody . Firstly , because she is the same age as me with similar interests and experience of life , and secondly , because the organization " Literacy for Life " , which she founded with another celebrity , is more important than ever . In my opinion , Jacqueline Brody , who acted as a movie actress and also as a longstanding theater actress is a strong and very good example . Because her worktools are the language , the speech and the written part . She does not boast about her skills , and so it is little known : the fact that she has recently been given an award of three countries for her work to raise awareness about child illiteracy . But not only the children have to be taught . Also illiterate adults have to learn to read and write . For this purpose , Jacqueline Brody is constantly searching for financial support for the organization . I sincerely believe she will be successful in her efforts .
Learning to extract information from varied sources is essential to the learning process . We can seek information pertinent to the question on an information wheel . Students begin by reading and discussing the topic . Next , students are introduced to an information wheel - a circle divided in few or many pieces , each labeled with a different question about the topic . Then various resources are shared with students as they decide where on the wheel each fact or statement about the topic should be recorded . Guiding the listening , looking and learning process helps students gain confidence and develop strategies for gathering information independently .
When. I got married ,. I needed to making a funding at a bank to get a good house . Therefore my wife and. I went to visit a manager of a bank to know how works the home loan . In a first moment , we stayed happy and excited to close the deal because the plan totally was suitable for us . Then , the Manager offered us a lot of papers like contracts , rules and forms , to read them , fill in them and sign them . Really we stayed very scared with the amount of documents that we would need to get . But we didnot give up . We knew that it would be a battle . Now. I donot remember but the documents demanded were over twenty . It was a terrible experience to get them . Here in Brazil this is called bureaucracy . We spent about two months to gather all this paperwork . After that , we just needed to pay off our debts and outstanding balance of funding .
I am a scientist , so. I am more a logical kind of person . Since. I am also a very visual person techniques like mind - mapping seem to work best , when. I am trying to get to the core of a problem or to summarize a text . I always find it fascinating , when more creative types of people use methods like free writing and loop writing . For some people this seems to work really well and they get great results , just by writing down whatever is on their mind at the moment . Another technique that is very helpful in science is using metaphors . For many people natural sciences are very hard to grasp and by using metaphors , we can make difficult topics more understandable . This is actually a big part of the job : Communicating your research . If you are not able to do that , the best results are worth nothing , because no one will ever know and no one will be able to apply your research to their specific problem . So another technique that is helpful in telling others about your research is using hyperboles . That way you can really emphasize on the core point of your findings .
I would like to express my opinion about today 's young female singers . I think they represent very bad role models for teenagers . first of all , they are more TV phenomenons that real artists . It appears that they show themselves only for promoting brands ( clothes , makeup , ore whatever else ) , spreading kind of a " crazy lifestyle " . But. I would like to give them a piece of my mind : this is no good exemple . It is not real life spending your time partying and spending money on expensive and useless stuff . their is no pride being considered as a junky or an easy person . Because of these celebrities , young people turn themselves into media - hogging opportunist . Today , every TV channel diffuses it 's own reality show . This program has became normal , a way of becoming famous for random people . As Andy Warhol said , everyone is now able to become famous for <num> minutes . But how bad will be the consequence in the future ?
In my opinion , it may completely different between writing in English and Japanese . If. I would have to write some essay in English , free writing and loop writing might be the best way to accomplish it . Because English is my second language , so this task has a high probability of making mistakes . In addition , my vocabulary must be poor comparison with native . And. I think that native tend to dislike using same words in an essay , even though meaning is the same . If. I were using different techniques , it would be hardship to writing some phrases even the shortest one . In my case ,. I write down some sentences in English without any attentions like spelling or grammar . I think that this way may look similar to free writing . After that ,. I always reread my sentences carefully . Someone said that the sentences. I wrote were quite redundant ; therefore the loop writing must be needed for almost all Japanese . I think that simple is the best way to improve my English skills . While. I m writing an English document , most of the time ,. I m using the English dictionary . I wish. Ill be able to make English documents without any items .
I do not want to name names , but there is a certain male singer who. I think is nothing but a media - hogging opportunist . He loves to champion the cause of Housing for Humanity , the charity that builds affordable homes for the poor , but. I know something that many people do not . A good friend of mine also volunteers at Housing for Humanity , and she saw this singer arrive the other day to supposedly work on the construction of a new home . He arrived with all sorts of assistants and media people . He gave interviews to the local media and talked about how important this charity was to him . As soon as the interviews were over , he left . My friend said he did not hit one nail ! Granted , this guy donates a lot of money to the charity , but how hard is that for someone who is very wealthy ? I am sick and tired of celebrities pretending to be something they are not . This guy was in work clothes and had tools on his belt so the media would report that he was constructing houses for poor people . He has no business pushing this kind of image of himself when it 's just not true.
Robots in my country By now , there are no intelligent service robots in the households . Though , on the other hand , most electric devices contains some kind of a microprocessor that makes them intelligent in some kind of way . In my opinion these are the precursor of those service robots . Nevertheless , the influence of those robots is quite difference . For the good they are simplifying the life a lot allowing the user a broad range of functions by just pushing some buttons . But the negative aspect of robots is the dependency of human life on robots as well as electric power . Considering the problems during a blackout must result in the opinion that robots are defining our daily life . And this conclusion can be emphasized by looking at the development of work conditions . Where once have been manufactures now there are assembly lines where most of the work is done by robots . This lead to the loss of many jobs . So to put all in a nutshell the future of robots and with robots has a great potential but also contains a great dependency and can result in negative effects .
Hello , The celebrity. I would  like to throw a brick at is Johnnie Oliviera , that so - called chef who is fooling everyone by condemning junk food while at the same time endorsing junk food in Asia . You have all heard of Johnnie Oliviera , the renowned TV chef , who wrote the highly praised best - seller ' Fast Food Fine Dining ' . He is also known for creating the reality program ' So you think you can cook ? ' that is due to air in the fall of next year . Do you think you know this famous so - called chef ? This man is an outspoken defender of the ' Leave the junk out of your trunk ' TV ad campaign aimed at teenagers and their poor eating habits . He enjoys every opportunity to champion this cause . Well , let me open up your eyes and shed light on this character ... It appears that this fake chef wears corsets to keep in his ever - growing stomach . What is more , he endorses a brand of sodium - laden chips sold across Asia . What a nice example , is not it ? Do what. I say , not what. I do ...
There are many names for it : Yeti , Sasquatch , Kaptar , Kikomba and , in North America , Big Foot . All around the world there have been sightings of a mysterious creature . Where does Big Foot come from ? The researchers who believe in the existence of this creature believe that Big Foot is a relative of the Gigantopithecus , a giant ape which has been extinct for over <num> years . The trend seems to be that there is only one person who sees the creature at a time . Critics find this a bit dubious . Also , skeptics often ask , if there are so many occurrences with these creatures , why are nt there more photographs of them ? Supporters of Big Foot counter these arguments . They say that the person who sees the creature is so surprised that they are not in a position to take a picture . They also claim that if these creatures have been around over <num> years then they have learned to adapt and survive in this world , eluding humans . We are still searching for the truth about Big Foot . As time continues , we may find the answers .
Dear Teacher , Now. I should to describe how robots are being used in Russia . To my shame ,. I never did see them before and , surely ,. I do not collect information about robots or automatons . But live and learn ! Firstly ,. I need to say that my country does not extend enough generosity and invest in this technology because you government thinks it is not safest to put up money in the area where they can not get a benefit immediately . Secondly , in my surroundings when someone talks about robots. I guess it 's humanoid robots . I mean they are an automatons that exhibits features of a human and artificial intelligence ( Al ) . Scientists work strenuously on ability robots will imitate humans . Unfortunately , today we are so far , they are pretty good at copying what we do . Robots have limited skills and . I 's not ready for the market , if. I am not mistaken . On the other hand , robotics is very immensely profitable if you view a situation from a new perspective . Robots are able to do menial anthropomorphic job and even more efficient . Finally , we need to delegated to robots all humans ' activities that can be programmed and we should to begin with all processes linking physical power , in my humble opinion.
During the conference there were <num> presenations describing very peculiar types of robots . First speaker , Hiro Takashi , was telling the audience about his plans to develop antropomorphic robots . His team is currently making service robots which are able to display human intelligence : sadness and happiness . And it even burps ! A challenge for the next <num> years is to make these robots more humanoid , breaking their artificial manner of speech and emotions . Bonnie , african enthusiast , focuses on robots for medicine and health . She 's currently developing Florence , a robot designed to provide help in hospitals . Bonnies future plans include care for quarantine patients suffering from contagious diseases . She hopes that Florence will get its own personality within the next <num> years . Major Pettigrew , former military serviceperson , was speaking about robots for leisure industry . Primarily for sports . He 's making pet dog robots which are capable of competing in various sport events . His main concern is to breathe life into these dogs , adding some . I .
Most of my time is at home . I do interior design course on some days of the week , and other days. I am at home , sometimes doing nothing or else doing the housework . Love the days that. I occupy studying me , because since. I decided that would be as professional , kept thinking to just start studying about it . Now. I am learning , doing projects , thinking about the incredible opportunities that will arise for my future ,. I am increasingly excited . My boyfriend is one of the most important parts for everything that happens , he always encouraged me and always supporting me and thinking about the future with me , making plans . I also like the time. I spend at home resting and doing house chores , because. I love taking care of the house , and always have everything neat and cozy home where. I always feel good about being . The end of the week. I get home quietly enjoying with my boyfriend and had a great time together just the two of us at home .
In Taiwan , sadly to say , it is almost impossible for young people to buy properties in Taipei , the capital city . The prices there are unbelievable high- you need to pay nearly <num> million NT dollars for a 60-square meter flat in the city centre . How expensive is it ? A young person in Taiwan , even gained his / her bachelor degree from a decent university , only gets on average of <num> thousand NT dollars a year . It means that even he / she does not drink or eat , it still needs his/her <num> year 's salary to buy a pathetically tiny flat . Although the government lend mortgage to young people ( under <num> ) with small , merely <num>  , interest , few young people are willing to use this offer and buy themselves a flat . Does high prices of properties mean good economy in Taiwan ? Definitely not . The rates of unemployment are getting higher every year . And , surprisingly , there is an abundant amount of empty flats in Taipei for people can not afford buying any of them . Incredible ? But it is what damned truely happens in this island .
It is actually no wonder and surprise that human beings tend to worship somebody than their own . As. I have heard from a renown biological scientist Richard Dawkins .. It has been built into our mentality through DNA and evolution that we possess this predisposition to worship and follow the leader of the pack . Actually , similar phenomena do occur in the celebrity circles . Individual celebrities granted with enormous fame and wealth , usually accompanied with power . Which would make them appear to be almost superhuman - like or god - like to us amere mortals ' . I do not like it personally . I think although celebrities tend to be famous for their excellence in a particular field , their monetary wealth are usually at an obscene level that totally dwarfed the significance of their personal achievements . Also people should stop being fanatic about celebrities or their personal affairs , for it is not only detrimental to the way you are living , but also , ask yourself , what is your life worth if your beloved celebrity fades into oblivion ?
My wife and. I have lucky enough to own our own home , We have good jobs and a solid credit history . When my father died , he left me some money and we used that as a down paymente on a home loan . I feel very fortunate . Before looking for a home , we had to sit down with a mortagage broker . We needed to be ' pre - approved ' for a home loan so we could actually make an offer on a home if we found one . The process was very complicated , requiring an incredible amount of paperwork When we were finally ready to star looking , we contacted a real estate broker . He showed us more than <num> homes . Once or twice we found a home that we liked , but before we had a chance to consider making an offer , the home was fone , purchased by someone else . We finalu found a lovely home in our price range and our offer was accepted . looking back , it was far from easy , put owing our home makes all the trouble well worth it .
I am staying with my parents in my hometown ( Jakarta ) . Jakarta is the capital city of. Indonesia . Jakarta is the city that never dies . We are staying in the building that contains shop and house in the same building . The shop is located in the first floor and the second until fourth floors are our house . Therefore , my father is running his business in the first floor . Sometimes ,. I help him in running their business after school . I asked my father " how much for bought this house and the procedures " ? My father said this house was cheap when he bought it <num> years ago and easy to got it . There are a lot of documents to fulfill and keep it . He did not use estate agent . He paid by cash so there was no interest rates . Now a days , the price of land and building increases rapidly year by year . In my knowledge , the interest rate of borrowing money from the bank to buy a house is very high and it depends on the market . We all know that the interest rate in the market always increase . Therefore , it becomes more expensive to buy house .
I live in Germany , which is one of the most industrialized countries in the world . Technological research in Germany is highly developed and robots are widely used , especially in the industry . Of course , virtually all large manufacturing companies use robots for production . But , due to high salaries , also middle - sized companies have started automating production , in order to save costs in a very competitive global market . Someone complains that robots will steal jobs from regular employees , therefore causing layoffs and salary reductions . I actually think that robots will just force each of us to seek jobs with a higher skill level . This kind of jobs will never disappear , in my opinion , because if there is something that a robot can do , there are some tasks that are much more complex than that ... for example , building and programming robots . A negative impact. I can predict , however , is that more and more people will " unlearn " to do some simple tasks because they will be almost exclusively performed by robots . For example , already now almost nobody can do a multiplication by hand , because there are calculators available .
Legend : Chupacabra The Chupacabra is an animal that sucks the blood of farm animals , especially goats . It attacks this farm animals and drinks their blood . Its homeland is Puerto Rico , Mexico , Latin America , United States . The Chupacabra has the size of small bear . Its main characteristic is the row of spines which go from neck to tail . It seems like to be a mixture of a dog , rat , and kangaroo . On the one hand it has fangs and a forked tongue on the other hand it is hairless and reptile - like with scales . Another characteristics are its red glowing eyes and its bad stench . Standing upright it reaches a hight of <num> - <num> feet . Its locomotion is hopping like a kangaroo . Its characteristic sounds are hisses and screeches . In <num> , it was seen in Puerto Rico for the first time , when eight sheep had punctured marks with dried blood drains . Months after this report , <num> farm had this typical infringement . This injuries stem from the Chupacabras when it bits the farm animals and sucks out the animals ' blood .
In my opinion the free writing technique could be very useful for many types of work . I use it so often and so instinctively that. I have to admit that no longer think of it as a technique . I write a long stories for different children ages . This technique allows to me to start writing without any restrictions , just writing freely with my imaginations and thoughts , after writing tens of minutes the new story takes her shape and the characters start to react with each other . The other technique. I would like to talk about is loop writing , this would allow me to think through all of the details . summarize them , rethink them , summarize them again . This technique gives me the opportunity to link the ideas together by summarizing each paragraph before starting the next one . I believe that final summary could give me a jump - start on a powerful lead paragraph . finally , each kind of writings would be adapted with certain technique that gives him the thoughts fluidity and the strong construction of the writing .
There are plenty of robots are being used in my country . You can find robots in the industry such as machinery . They are replaced people by doing menial work . The only problem people think it would be a deficit of working places . Recently it was a underground strike because of government proposal to use a ticket machines on the stations and close ticket offices . People could loose about <num> work places as an outcome . We need to figure out how to embed robots in our life without just replacing people . In some fields robots are successfully used helping to improve quality of life , to produce dangerous and heavy work , to watch out for criminal or danger ( for every four people in the UK there is one CCTV camera ) . I am not sure if. I would like to live with robots around alike people . It is very frustrating when you can not say for sure who you face robot or human being . ..
I work with technology , and in my job. I need to be creative . One of the best technique to register the ideas is using brainstorming to create a mind map . The result is an structured form of ideas , even without having to focus on listing them . I like to use metaphores to explain some situation , doing some similar examples in a diferent way . Its very efficient to simplify or make easier to understand , but we need to take care to not commit an deceit . That can lead us to false premisses and belive in some illogic statements . Cubing seems very interesting , because it can stimulate new approaches and provide a seed to ideas that can be the guide for the solution of several kind of problems . Some problems are solving with listing technique . Its very efficient to remember a right sequence of steps to complete an complex task or guide thru a list of important items that must to folow .
The Bridge . I have lived in Florianopolis for almost twenty . This is a peaceful place , without any factory or pollution around , having the tourism as the principal source of income . It 's a big island , located in the Southern of Brazil , surrounding with the green waters from the Atlantic Ocean . This paradise was discovery by the Portuguese during the 16th century . For many years , the local forty thousand inhabitants raise cattle , vegetables and fishing , living together with a huge problem to reach the development : the lack of a bridge connecting the island to the continent . It was in <num> , when the governor of the Mr Hercilio Luz contacted two american engineers , to build up the project of the biggest hanging bridge of the all South America . It had <num> meters as length , with two towers having <num> meters in height . All iron framework components used in the bridge were made in the USA , weighting five thousand tons . The bridge took four years to be finished , clearing the population from the ferryboat . It represented progress and nowadays is the postcard of my city .
Leprechauns are characters of. Irish Mythology . The word Leprechaun comes from the. Irish L Chorpain meaning small body . Indeed , this fairy usually takes the form of a small and old man in old style green clothes with a beard and hat . They are believed to hold magical powers that allow them to disappear and to travel great distances in the blink of an eye . That ability to travel and disappear fast makes them difficult to sight , let alone catch . However , if you are so good as to actually seize one , he will have to grant you three wishes in exchange for their release . Some say they might even lead you to their gold . Indeed , the leprechauns earn an outstanding living making shoes and , as they obsessively love money , store all the coins they gather in a crock that they hide at the end of the rainbow . They are said to be extremely rich . Their second passion after gold is mischief . They are slick talker and loves a bit of fun . Do not forget : never trust a Leprechaun !
My work will always have a good deal of stress because. I am a software developer and a major problem in this area is that those who sell are not always developers thus promise things and absurd deadlines . I am currently pursuing two colleges and this also adds to my stress . At home , my wife has a dog that. I do not like and looks like he does everything to annoy me . My great advantage is that things that relax me are simple . I love going to the movies , if. I could , would all weeks . I love to take long walks . I love to read , especially on issues such as economics , management and sociology . And principamente , love anime . Whenever. I have a break ,. I watch an episode of my favorite animes . These are the things that relax me , but. I also like cycling , swimming , going to the park , talking with friends while eating a pizza , etc .
I have never won a poetry competition mainly. I like to think because. I have not entered many but. I did once win a cash prize for a short story and then of course. I won the peter pock humorous novel contest with stiff competition a novel that had previously been rejected by a top publisher for being too funny see comps novel. I therefore speak from experience when O say that winning small lesser known competitions does not lea to overnight fame and but having a few such successes to boat about does you no harm when approaching editors or agents so if you do have dreams of a writing career this could be the place to begin and or maybe you just ant to sum some money and whatever your motives the only advice. I can offer is to suggest you emulate my old friend pecy verge who reads writes reads writes and infintuim below is a list of the most interesting uk writing competitions i ve four recently entry is not necessarily limited to uk residents .
In the one hand , There is not much to say about robots in my country . We do nt have the manufacturer profile , we kind of depend much of imported manufactured goods . The industry was forgot here , the academic researches have practically no investments and the government has no clear intentions to promote these areas . In the other had ,. I believe that the robots came to stay . They materialize the computer programs in the way that they do the repetitive tasks we do nt want to do , do not make mistakes and make our lives convenient . Robots can do menial work , they can assist people in their house , explore dangerous places such as deep water . In fact ,. I think that well get used to them in our lives , they will be everywhere , in form of self - driving cars , smart appliances . Every single electronic is in the running to have an artificial intelligence today . I do nt think robots or computers will have real feelings in the future , but if it comes real. I do nt believe it ll be threatening for us .

Hiro Takashi from Asia ( ? ) is working in the field of anthropomorphic robots . His predecessor and professor was a member of the team to built one of the first robots . It could move , had the size of a few people and was controlled by computers big as a whole room . Hiro and his team developed a service and escort robot . It can wink , express sadness and burp ( quite useful ) . H. T. and his team expect to give it more humanoid expressions and features during the next <num> years . Bonnie from Africa knows about the first priority not only in her continent : to improve people 's life . She tells about Florence , a small robot who is at present cleaning trash from the floors of a Hospital . Major goal for Bonnie is to give Florence or sub the ability to visit contagious people which normally can not be visited because of quarantine . A certain Major Pettigreee saw robots working in the field when he was still in active service . The robots cleaned battlefields or man made desaster areas . Now he 's moved to softer domains : soccer playing robodogs. He expects the dogs to play by <num> against humans ( if these are not extinct by this time ) . If yes , the world would be in control of EMO. IONALLY SAVY ROBOTS !

For me every of the nine writing techniques are useful . When you write a Poem , for example , you should use metaphors , hyperboles , sympolism and so on . Your Poem will become more interesting . These things Show the Reader that you can use the language very well and that you know how you can write something more exiting . And the techniques which help you if you stuck up . E. g. the focused free writing , Loop writing , listing , questioning and cubing are always very useful . They Help with the start and when you don not know how your text will going on . For me the most useful technique is the questioning technique . Because when you answer all " wh- " question you get an overview about what is importnat and what is not . All techniques are good when you Need a start and wants to get an overview about what you want to write . I Thing everybody Need to test what is the best technique for him / her and than it could help everytime when you will be helpless . And when your normally technique doesn ' t help you can try another . That is very helpfull .
It is well known that robots are everywhere nowadays . We can find them at the supermarket as cashiers , in factories performing assembly - line jobs and , if we are lucky , they are cleaning our homes ! In my country the use of domestic robots is not so extended , but they are broadly used in farms and agriculture . For instance , milking yards are saving time and money when they replace human work with machines . In addition , working in a milking yard has always been an extremely tough job and it is good that it can be performed automatically . On the other hand , innovation in robotics has made possible to think in a better future for eldery people . With elder population growing constantly , robots could provide care and companion . Some people can argue that the progresses in Artificial intelligence will allow the robots to rule the world . In my humble opinion , the advantages of robotics exceed possible risks and we do not have to forget that robots are created by humans and the potential dangers are our responsibility .
Creative writing techniques are a helpful tool . Not only for people with writer 's block but for anyone who does not just want to put down words but create a good piece of writing . Personally ,. I favor a combination of listing and the loop writing technique when. I start a new writing project . As a linear person. I appreciate the logical form of listing which lets me write down whatever comes to my mind . Seeing my ideas laid out in an organized way helps me to find the central theme that. I want to follow through my text and using bullet points makes it easy to keep track . After making the list. I let my creative juices flow and start to write freely and without worrying about grammar or the right punctuation for some minutes . This way. I get rid of my inner lecturer that keeps me from writing by being too perfectionistic . Once. I am done with the first draft. I reread it , find the main point and use it to write another summery . I go on with the loop writing technique until it gets clear to me what. I really want to write about . The final draft often only needs some editing before it becomes the finished work.
<num> ) Keep your introduction brief , and introductory . 2 ) People the story . As one academic pointed out to a publishing panel , You talk a lot about narrative . 3 ) Let the people move . Often , a person in an academic book is a portrait on the wall born at a certain time in a certain place , surrounded by carefully selected context , but not actually doing anything . 4 ) Honor chronology . Academic work is often organized thematically , but in writing for general readers , chronology is almost always your best friend . 5 ) Do nt bury your favorite details . 6 ) Do nt talk down to your audience . 7 ) Accept that some subjects are inherently of minor interest and others fall into genres that have become overcrowded . 8) A book should not be ones first and only attempt to address the public . 9 ) To recycle an old creative writing maxim , Break any rule when to do so serves a higher purpose or , when you can write so brilliantly as to get away with it .
I have to put many extra hours in my job so that the best way to relax my working stress is taking exercise , sometimes. I go jogging in the weekend or go to a gym to have some muscle training ,. I am a computer engineer , that 's the reason why. I choose sport as my way of relaxing ,. I have to spend many hours starring at screen , if. I play computer games after work ,. I just spend more hours on starring at screen , but if. I take some exercise ,. I recharge my batteries with moving my body , and that 's what. I need so much . The key to deal with the stress is to live a different life style from the source of stress , like balancing the office work by sports or balancing the science research work by going to an art exhibition , by the way , the ideal life is that we can balance our working achievement , social life and the physical health .
It is well - known , the Red Square is one of the main symbols of Russia . The name Red Square derives neither from the colour of the bricks of the Kremlin 's walls nor from link between the colour red and communism . The archaic meaning of Russian word " krasnaya " ( " red " ) is " beautiful " . This word was originally applied to Saint Basil 's Cathedral and later transferred to the nearby square . The fabulous - looking Saint Basil 's Cathedral is shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky . It was erected on the order of. Ivan the Terrible to commemorate the capture of Kazan in <num> - <num> by talented architects Barma and Postnik . The legend held that. Ivan. IV blinded them so they could not re - create the masterpiece elsewhere . The Cathedral consists from nine churches which are united together . The central core and the four larger churches are octogonal , the four diagonally placed smaller churches are cuboid . With diligence and love ancient builders used red bricks as a decorative medium inside and outside , leaving as much brickwork open as possible . Eight small onion domes around the central tent covered with tin , tiles and dyed into vivid colours . Very thick walls inside are decorated with murals and floral ornaments . Several times the Cathedral was burnt , but like a phoenix it revived again . I am proud of my country and the roots of it are in the long and exciting history of Russia , in victories and achievements of my ancestors .
Today we will be looking at three kinds of robots still in progress , each with its own features and purposes . Coming from Japan , scientists are working on a service robot that could mimic the facial expressions of the human face . Finally , they have reason to celebrate as one of their prototypes has winked for the first time . Until then , its possibilities were limited to basic expressions of sadness and happiness , and burping . The second robot performs its duties in Africa . Also a service robot , it picks up litter in a local hospital and acts as a mobile surveillance camera to help guards oversee the area . Only two feet small , it is expected to be enlarged for its next mission - to interact with patients who are not allowed visitors due to the contagious state of their illness . The third kind is concerned with sports and calls USA its home . It is a robotic pet dog designed for international competitions where speed , agility and performance are judged and would be classified under hobbies as opposed to those mentioned above .
Dear Sir and Madam , I am writing to request for a bank loan to buy a house . My name is Rosa R Bennet and. I live in Victoria , Australia . I was born on the 30th March <num> . I added my driver 's license , my credit card , my bank statement and the property purchase contract for this application . I decided to buy a house because. I believe that in the long run it will be more economical for me . I do not have to pay a montly rent and. I think to have a own house is also very safe in a depression . The purchase price will be  <num> for the real estate . My equity capital is  <num> and the home loan should be  <num> . The agreement between buyer and seller is contingent upon buyer 's ability to obtain a home loan in the amount of  <num> . I do not accept any loan with interest rate exceeding <num>  amortized over <num> years . Yours sincerely , Rosa R Bennet
Well ,. I admit that robotics is not a area that. I am pleased to discuss ... Nonetheless ,. I think the first robot is more focused on imitating a human being , which would be a big advance for the scientific researches . The second one , in my opinion will be the more useful nowadays . With all the injuries of the people , and with just a few people working in a hospital , a robot would be making their work easier . The last one , in my opinion , is an unimportant robot , because it is only directed for fun . Who cares about a pet dog robot , when we have a lot of real dogs neglected on the streets ? What about about a robot playing games ? To wind up the subject ,. I think that the science should move forward with the necessary things . It 's cool to see the science moving , but we wo not replace a human with a robot , as we wo not replace a pet with a pet robot . I might be wrong , but this is my point of view ...
There 's Tim Banks in the paper again . Honestly , that man gets himself onto the TV and into the newspapers on every possible occasion to promote himself . He 's just a media - hogging opportunist , in my opinion . Have you heard about Melanie Z ? She wants all her fans to go to her website and write to the government to tell them to do something to stop global warming . She 's petitioning for support on her next concert tour too . I think it 's shocking . There 's so much poverty in the world and here 's all these mega - movie stars earning big bucks . I think they get involved in all these causes just to ease their guilty consciences . It 's hard to believe that such a prominent business leader has been accused of hitting his wife . Domestic violence seems to be on the increase these days everywhere you look . I think every celebrity should be made to champion a cause , no matter whether it 's to fight hunger , rebuild homes after earthquakes , or work to improve human rights around the world . They have so much and there are so many people in the world with so little .
Not to make a too fine point on it ,. I just do not like how some people look up to the celebrity these days . Their hunger for knowing what these people are doing every day has given the paparazzi and columnists the reason of invent stupid jobs and making money out of it . Lets face it ! There 's no entertainment in looking on how other people entertain themselves , unless going out and try to have an exciting life yourself . But that is the problem with our society . We became so alien to socializing that TV and watching what other people 's life become the second best . That is sad . Oh , and do not get me started on celebrity supporting causes . This is just a lame reason to re launch a dying carrier . And to know that some people believe they are actually genuine ? O my God , that tops it all . Just watch some of the Russel 's Brand interviews . He makes it clear on how fake and unreal this celebrity world is .
Boston Tea Party. In <num> , American patriots dressed as Mohawk. Indians entered in ships of the East. Indian Company docked in Boston harbor and took to the sea the tea was on the three ships . They emptied <num> chests of tea which was valued at more than <num> pounds . This situation who happened in Boston became known as the Boston Tea Party . The Boston Tea Party was a rebellious reaction to the Tea Act of <num> that was passed by Parliament to save the British East. India Company from Bankruptcy . However , there were rumors that the Tea Act created an illegal monopoly , so resistance to the importation of tea was encouraged throughout the colonies . The Tea Act essentially eliminated all taxes on tea except the three pence Townshend tax . More importantly , it offered Americans tea at lower price than that of the colonial smugglers would be out of business and the principle of parliamentary taxation would be upheld . To me the Boston Tea Party is the start of a new taxation rule in the US and another countries too .
Five days back ,. I started to prepare myself for a writing section in. IELTS exam , which. I plan to take in June . Today 's lesson devoted variety of writing techniques was very helpful and timeous , thanks to EnglishTown . Some of them seemed to me quite difficult such as metaphor and hyperbole which are more convenient for writing on your mother tongue and may lead to a misunderstanding using foreign one , in my case . However , there were a couple of techniques which everyone , preparing to. IELTS is advised to become familiar . First of all , a listing approach can help you to organize your main thoughts by just numbering them in a certain order . I used it instinctively when. I needed to describe graphs or charts . The next useful one is free writing . I could identify it as the most important technique for me , because. I usually have some trouble to start merely writing first words . Sometimes only one thing. I need is to make a first step and then. I get involved in a process , full of thoughts and ideas . In order to avoid a meaningless wordplay on the sheet of paper , loop writing is the last perfect thing .
Despite thinking that some celebrities and their causes just pains in the neck , these people can raise awareness about human issues by appealing to their fan base and how they are in evidence , must set a good example . We probably would nt know about some of these problems if it were nt for them . What. I believe to be awful is celebrities give bad examples , taking drugs , smoking , get drunk and break establishments in public . These people are always imitated by thousands of people and they need to use this power for good and not for bad . The most important is : celebrities put their names in charity campaigns and what is the real gain for people benefited by this ? Star gain fame but the people ca nt be use to promove and provide status . Its critical that these charity campaigns actually promote improvements in the lives of the people involved or all this does nt make sense .
In my country , germany , robots are being used mainly in the industrial sector . For example the car industry , or by steel producing companies like Thyssen Krupp . In these areas. I think that robots are an advantage because they help minimize risk of human workers getting harmed in dangerous situations . On the other hand there is always the problem of work - space being reduced . A robot can work for more hours than any human being and it doesnot need any breaks nor vacation . For one robot several workers become obsolete . Our society should carefully reconsider in which areas to use robots . In the sectors. I mentioned above robots have become very important tools . In the end even there every robot is being watched over and taken off by at least one human expert . So they do not make human workers obsolete at once . Another area where robots are very important is preventing and dealing with natural desasters . Like in Japan after the Tsunami in <num> when robots investigated the radioactive sites . Or after earthquakes when robots enter small spaces to look for survivors . Carefully used robots are a great advantage for our life . As long as human mankind is the most important thing.
At the moment. I am staring at an empty white square on my screen and it 's like meditating . My mind goes complete blank ,. I am breathing deeply and regularly ... * snore * Hmph ? Oh , sorry , so much about the relaxing part ... As a matter of fact. I am using my English classes to relax . During my lunch break or in the evening hours. I am taking classes . I read my lectures when riding the bus or. I watch English TV when. I am eating . Once in a while my husband and. I visit a friend who owns an English pub . I am feeling the most important impact from stress when. I am at work and we are offering a special discount in an advertisement supported sales campaign . At this time. I am placing the sales orders , dealing out advice to customers and answering the E-Mails all at once . Do not tell me that 's not possible . It is . I can proof it ! At times like these. I tend to sneak out at noon and visit our Danish baker shop . They have delectable fresh bread . I top them with some delicious cheese , have a tea or coffee and stroll down to the museum harbour , where. I sit down on a bench. The old ships are swaying on the waves . Their sails are nice empty white squares . My mind goes completely blank and. I am breezing deeply and regulary ... * snore * ~~~~
The future , what amazing topic to daydream , but. I can not talk about it , if. I do not talk about the present . In this days , the invasion of robots is a reality . We could see them for every where , in factories to making cars or airplanes , exploring the space , in homes to helping with a day to day chores , in fact the cars in this days are a sort of robot because it can run and stop alone or get you a warning if you are driving by wrong site . This trend make easier life to human beings . However , in my humble opinion , the scientifics have to take extremely careful how to use the robots , my concern is that this kind of technology would increase the rate of unemployment . To be honest they make more work , more exact , they do not need to rest , and without social demands ,. It meaning that they are better in some kind of work . In the other hand the robots need somebody who can fix and give maintenance to them , so that. I will hope to be a sort of doctor - robot to them .
Robots are being used in many countries , for example perform precise surgeries or some highly dangerous jobs or just for entertainment or as a company . Put the grograms that you need into the robots. It seems to me that is more good than harm so far . The downside of it. I think more and more people will lose their job , some easily jobs robots could replace them to do it . In the furture human may become weak , because in that case , when we need something we have our robot to do it for us , we do not need to go outside anymore or converse with other humans anymore . However ,. I am so expect robot 's day to come . Becuase. I would  like to have one to teach me languages which. I want to learn . we can practise together then. I wo not feel alone anymore or afraid of make mistakes in front of a real human being .

In a beautiful evening of May ,. I walked to the top of the highest Mountain of Massachusetts " Greylock Mountain " and then. I stop and paid attention to God 's tremendous creation . A calm and smooth breeze touch my body and waved my hair . Then. I looked to the horizon and. I saw the colorful and wonderful sunset in which. I pay attention to its details . It came a deeply thought in my mind , a relax inspiration but at the same time strong , it was like drinking from the source of wisdom and rejuvenation . When. I looked around me ,. I saw that two hours had passed since that scene had started . At first there were some people around me , but then. I found myself alone . I got up to go home and behold ,. I thought to myself how wonderful it would be to have that experience everyday . My body felt light as if. I was walking on the clouds .
The Brazilian folklore is very diversified , it has a lot of kind of creatures living in different places like river , forest or sky . One of this creatures is the Saci - Perer , second the Saci-Perers legend it is a creature represented by a little black boy who only has one leg and lives in the forest . He always is seen with his pipe and with a red cap which gives him magical powers . Lives up to mischief and has a lot of fun with it . He love horses , burn the peoples food and amazing wake up people with high laughter .

Saci - Perer is as famous in Brazil that in <num> , was created the day of saci , it should be celebrated on October <num> the same day of Halloween .
I do nt name names , but there is this famous american actress , who. I think is nothing but a media - hogging opportunist . She have jumped on a voguish bandwagon , to indirectly boost her flagging career . Well - known for her charity and commitment towards animals rights , was well spotted ( ! ) at the Golden Globe after party wearing a mink coat . Furthermore , the paparazzi took a photo of her eating a steak in ' The Steak House ' . That would nt be a big thing , if she had nt declared her as a vegan , last spring in the Tonight Show . The pious posturing comes down to nothing more than smoke and mirrors designed to keep her in the spotlight . In the other hand ,. I think its great ; these people can raise awareness about issues by appealing to their fan base . We need all the role - models we can get . Their support for a brand , a humanitarian cause , or some eco - friendly gadget or device shows the rest of us a model to emulate .
I like the legend or story of Nessy , the monster living in a lake in Scotland , near the little town called. Inverness . There are so many people reporting about seeing Nessy and some of them have taken photos of Nessy , but those photos are not really good . They are mostly unclear and you only can see a kind of shadow from a big snake . The extent is supposed by <num> feet high with a very ugly head . Nessy is characterized as bad and dangerous . Because it is so great , it is able to overturn boats and ships travelling on the lake . Every summer when the tourist season starts many newspapers publishes articles about Nessy and that someone has sawn the monster in the lake again . Therefore a plenty of tourists spend their holidays nearby , hoping to see Nessy themselves . Most scientist , and so do. I , believe that there is no monster in the lake . Its only a myth .
My lifestyle has changed entirely , it is a notorious contrast between the past and now the present . 2 years back then ,. I was at a high level of stress that there was a point where. I could not even eat properly ,. I had sleep deprived , and yet worse , all my average of school notes were down . When. I had recharged my batteries ,. I decided on researching why. I was experiencing all those problems , curiously , all this stress was caused by high blood preassure , and an unbalanced way to eat . All of these number of issues faded away when. I realized what my body needed was an extreme transformation . How do. I deal with it now ? , Simple ,. I try to have my three meals every day ,. I took up jogging , which. I do every morning , and more important ,. I sleep <num> hours so when you wake up the following day you will feel revitalized and full of energy .
Artificial. Intelligence is a modern science has gained importance in recent years for numerous applications in vital areas such as medicine , science , military , ntelligence and computer and machine translation , and others . There is no doubt that the great progress that the world is witnessing in all fields is due some of the credit for it to computing devices.And may be too early to talk about the virtues of computers and smart but undoubtedly that smart computers playing a growing role in many areas at the moment and waits for her to reach a large affair in the near time . Whatever the case , the superiority of machines in human intelligence , will remain depends on research and the superiority of the human mind , and its uniqueness in the leadership of the achievements of no prior knowledge of human societies . The exit of these machines for control will remain as well as research depends on human beings themselves , and creativity of the human mind always wants to explore and future prospects attendance , anticipation about what is hidden in the jungles of the remote spaces , and nearby at the same time .
The numbers of companies that are using robots in Brazil are increasing considerably and in many different areas . One good example is the car industry , where robots can perform tasks that humans often found dangerous , and it could do them with consistent speed and precision . There are also an increased number of surgeons that are using robots to assist them in delicate microsurgery . The recent news are saying that Brazil will use robots to police the <num> World Cup , they will be programmed to analyze suspicious - looking objects in <num> cities . I believe that robots are very useful in many cases , when they have to perform dangerous or boring tasks . But it could also be dangerous for humans because they can be used by the military force to kill people . I think that it must have a limit to the tasks that can be performed by robots ; after all they do not have emotions or blame to deal with . And because all of this. I believe that. Isaac Asimov is right about creating the Three Laws of Robotics and the first one is the most important law : a robot can not injury a human being .
robots can make our life easier but it can be counterproductive because they are .. let 's say stealing job , they are doing works that before where made by human being , that people have been displaced , but in the other hand the robots are making all theirs jobs faster , and better , they can work 24/7 without stop , you don'y have to pay them every <num> days and it wo not sue you if something wrong happen , those are some ideas that. I have. I guess that the goverment and abviously we must think about it and try the choose the best for all of us because in the future we can regret many of the choices that we have taken . I think that 's scary and excited . ..
It seems to me that listing and free writing would be effective for my writing . I do not want to say that other seven techniques introduced in this unit are not useful but for essays. I think the two. I mentioned above will be useful as well as necessary . I have to write as many essays as feasible , so listing will help me a lot . For instance , before writing the entire essay. I can just list facts and figures , details and main ideas then organize and prioritize them . Using this technique while writing TOEFL essay will be very clever and successful step as a result essay will be well organized . Another technique. I would like to try is free writing . I think that free writing will help me become more creative and it will also make my essay interesting and strong . I can brainstorm ideas write as many of them as comes to my mind and then reorganize them . I am sure free writing will improve my writing skills .
UFO is an abbreviation for " Unidentified Flying Object " ; it has been originally coined by the military , but most of the people associate it to the idea of aliens visiting our planet . An object or phenomenon is classified as UFO when the observer is not immediately able to identify and classify it . The vast majority of the sightings have a rational explanation , however , the idea that UFOs are alien spacecrafts visiting the Earth is so intriguing that UFO constitutes a widespread cultural phenomenon . A survey conducted in the 70s found that <num>  of the public heard of UFOs whereas only <num>  knew the name of the president in office . According to another recent poll <num>  of the public believes in UFO having extraterrestial origin . But if we consider rationally the facts , we need to conclude that , despite the sophisticated technology we have at our disposal , there is no scientific evidence that the phenomena classified as UFOs have extraterrestrial origin . On the contrary , the scientific facts against the existence of alien UFOs are definitely much more than the dubious cases that have no explanation yet .
In my country , Brazil , the robots are mostly used in automotive industries , almost by subtracting the total staff , but is otherwise in surgery and other branches , are not used , but. I am glad for developing these more developed countries . Robots help perform more than <num> surgeries per year in the US . They explore places humans can not , such as the deepest parts of oceans and space . But most often , robota perform routine , assembly - line Jobs that increase productivity and lower costs , like packaging produce or attaching wheels to cars . Robots perform na increasingly large proportion of menial tasks in the US , which. I feel is a promising trend . The result is that companies can keep more Jobs in the country and increase the number of Jobs that require higher - level skills . Jobs that require these skills will still need to be performed by humans , at least in the foresseable future . I thing there is a major downside to this trend , however . As robots replace people doing manual work that can be completed by computers - Jobs usually held by poor and middle - class people - the line that separates the poor and rich will become that much more evidente . As this trend continues , we need to figure out how to add robots to create na optimal workforce instead of using them simply to replace humans.

The police was summoned by a local resident who saw a suspiciously acting , dark dressed person . Nearby policemen started the pursuit of the suspect . They successfully cornered him in Hamilton Road and arrested him at <num> am this morning .

There are many names for it : Yeti , Sasquatch , Kaptar , Kikomba and , in North America , Big Foot . All around the world there have been sightings of a mysterious creature that stands <num> - <num> feet tall . Just like the Loch Ness Monster and Crop Circles , for centuries people have been searching for the truth on the legend of Big Foot . Where does Big Foot come from ? The researchers who believe in the existence of this creature believe that Big Foot is a relative of the Gigantopithecus , a giant ape which has been extinct for over <num> years . There have been hundreds of reported encounters with Big Foot worldwide , but critics ask for proof . Most of the incidents related to Big Foot involve a lone camper or hiker . The trend seems to be that there is only one person who sees the creature at a time . Critics find this a bit dubious . Also , skeptics often ask , if there are so many occurrences with these creatures , why are nt there more photographs of them ? Supporters of Big Foot counter these arguments . They say that the person who sees the creature is so surprised that they are not in a position to take a picture. They also claim that if these creatures have been around over <num> years then they have learned to adapt and survive in this world , eluding humans . We are still searching for the truth about Big Foot . As time continues , we may find the answers .
Actually ,. I got a lot of stresses from my work , boss and company . I worked really hard and tight so. I felt that. I need a break and feel some fresh air . This are what. I want . I am walking towards the ocean through a lush , tropical forest . I can hear the leaves rustling above me in the soft breeze and smelll the fragrance of the tropical flowers wafting towards me . As. I approach the ocean. I can hear the gentle waves lapping on the shore , soothing and calming me . I find a place to lie down on the still warm sand and gaze up into the evening sky , watching the gentle pinks and reds of the sunset gradually sink below the horizen . The sand feels warm and soft beneath my bare feet . The sound of the light tropical breeze brushes the leaves of the pal trees as. I drift stowly .
Christ the Redeemer is a statue of Jesus Christ located in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil constructed between <num> - <num> , a christianism symbol , the monument has become one of the most known international icon of Brazil . In <num> july 7th in Lisboa it was elected one of the new <num> wonders of the world . It has <num> meters and it is the second largest statue of the world the first one is the Christ the King in Poland . Christ the Redeemer is a huge landmark of Brazil and thousands of people around the world come to see this great sculputure . This monument represents part of the history of Brazil . For me it is very important because it represents the Christianity in our country and we have to preserve this great statue that brings us a message of peace in its open arms . The whole world should receive this message , the world needs peace .
I have been researching about one of the big legends who scared people around the world along the years . The both existences are not prove yet , but along of the time people always register some view or relate about this creatures , even with any picture taken until now . Big foot was retrated in many movies in the last decades , in relates he is always a enormous strange animal , and on the contrary of the others animals like bears , he is a biped , walk with two legs , what do he appear more scare . The relates are typical in cold places , like Fuji Mountains and Alasca , the poor way which people live in this places justified people do not have resources to take a picture . No one fatal victim was related yet , so Big Foot do not seems appear much dangerous and a threat to the population . In my opinion , is strange people in different cultures and different places relate the exactly same creature , but the fact of do not have proofs it 's a reason to not believe ,. I think. I will just believe when. I see with my own eyes
The creative writing techniques , which had been intruduced here , could be useful for diffrent types of writing . The questioning technique will be used very often in handys . It 's used so instinctively that no one thinks of it as a technique . The technology articles , which. I write for a weekly banking magazine use a common jounalistic approach : answering the five ' wh'-questions as you write the first paragraph of the story . That is , how you can anticipate the most salient questions you might have about your article . Sometimes. I choose the looping writing when. I think that 's too difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff . I often do not know what the most relevant information is until. I sort through all the details . This technique allows me to think through all of the details , rethink them , summerize them again and again , At least. I can start with a jump writing a powerful lead paragraph ,
I found this lesson strongly interesting to me . I like reading any kind of books but. I also love writing . My favorite technique in writing are symbolism and metaphors , without any doubt . A symbol is anything that has a deeper meaning beyond its appearance . Symbolism is common in almost all classical books and it is used in writing as a powerful tool for passing any hidden or archaic message to the reader . I always used symbolism in my writing production , so longer and so often , that. I had not never thought of it as a technique , so far . On the other hand , metaphors in my opinion , are really useful for a story you want to tell without being obvious , or too detailed . It allows you describing about a situation and at the same time referring to another one , as it gives it a deeper meaning and lets the reader , connect and relate to the story in his own way . There are several ways of writing not only symbolism and metaphor , and it 's important to keep in mind that it is not mandatory the use of any writing technique : when we are writing a shopping - list or we are sending a text message to our friends!
I am fine thanks . I really understand your needs about writing techniques . It was a great lecture and. I took utterly interesting notes. I hope would help you steadily . Here there are the four writing techniques. I took notes about : Mind mapping o Same as clustering or diagramming o This technique is useful for left - brained people Listing o linear way of putting down your ideas about a topic o a more random way of recording concepts Questioning o. Imagine the responses your readers have about the topic o Use closed questions that need yes / no answers . Cubing o Start by writing down a key word on a blank piece of paper o Put the word in a cube o Respond to that question using subheadings which also be cube or boxed o use arrows / lines to show details between relationships. I hope that would be helpful . Tabby
The famous stone of Pfungstadt The stone was found in <num> and looks like a real diamant . It is a very famous symbol of love and freedom . Rarely this stone is well known by lots of people in Germany . The name of the stone is Romanzo . Why ? In former time italien people found it and named it . Situated on a small field , the Romanzo has been viited by lots of people . So it is not only the stone , the surrounding is also very intersting . In this small field you can sit in a boat and can drive around it . When the wheather is going to change , the colour of the stone changes as well . So each colour has it each explanation . As italien people found the stone and the stone has not been given to the country , there has been build a very good partnership between the countries . So ot only german peolpe looking for the stone , also italien people come to Pfungstadt and enjoy .
I have chosen to write about UFOs . I believe that the UFO may have existed in our universe . After the big bang , our universe expand in a huge room . If it is possible to form living organisms on Earth . it must also be possible to form living organisms out there somewhere . Perhaps they have been around for millions of years ago , long before us . They can be very smart , intellegent . In addition , we can find many status here on earth that is still mysterious . for example . Giza Pyramid in Egypt , how did people <num> years ago to build such a complex building that exists on our planet . A Greek philosophy as Plato also mentioned in his book on one emperium called Atlantis , where he also wrote that before Atlantis was gone there was a bright light around . It is possible that Atlantis that we have heard about the UFO , where they leave the soil with a spaceship that shoots up with smoke and flames behind him . They had to be here to give us the new knowledge to build complex buildings.
Unidentified Flying Object ( UFOs ) . This term was created by the Armed Forces of the United States to indicate any unidentified flying objects , including clandestine aircraft , aircraft used in espionage , possible attacks made by supposed enemies and missiles or even possible spacecraft from other planets . Description : a strange object , normally in oval shape , that some people claim to have seen in the sky and believe is a spacecraft from another planet . Background information : There are not any record of UFOs attack against human being . Even knowing that there are not any scientific evidence , lots of people around the world attest they have seen Unidentified Flying Object . Mostly of them did not report to the police nor to especialized departament for this kind of occurrence . In their reporting the eyewitnesses said they saw strong and bright light in the air , moving quickly . When questioned by sceptics why they did not take any picture , video or things like that , the eyewitnesses said : Everything happened so fast ... I had not camera ... I got paralyzed without reaction .
The robots are used in great car 's companies . The robots builds car , bus and others kind of machines . This robots have done the men 's work so that neither men neither women has died in this time . I believe that robots have one special place in companies . Where has exists hazard , they can work without problem . Where is necessary a huge process of data , the computers can make the difference and reach the best results and more fast . The men and robots can works together , so that our whole society wins .
Its sunny day . As. I approach the ocean. I can hear the gentle waves lapping on the shore , soothing and calming me . I can hear the leaves rustling above me in the soft breeze and smell the fragrance of the tropical flowers wafting towards me . I am walking towards the ocean through a lush , tropical forest . I find a place to lie down on the still warm sand and gaze up into the evening sky , watching the gentle pinks and reads of the sunset gradually sink below the horizon . The sand feels warm and soft beneath my bare beet . The sound of the light tropical breeze brushes through the palm trees as. I drift slowly , gently , towards sleep .
Brazilians belive in a monster called " chupacabra " . They found several animals like goats , cows , chickens , horses killed without blood in it bodies . Nobody ever saw any of them , but they supose it can be an alien animal or some creature like a mutant wolf because the strange traces arround the dead animals . This legend became more weaker since the dead animals without blood stopped to be found . Some said it can be just humans that drain the blood of the animals for some ritual , but the perfurations in the neck of the animals intrigued the farmers and the cientists . Several pictures of the dead animals was posted in the internet and on television several years ago . In Campina Grande city , <num> dead animals was found in a farm without blood and oddly stacked . Aliens , human rituals or mutants , wherever it was , they created a legend of the " chupacabra " in Brazil .
i like free writing . we can write about anything in the world . if it might be a simple tiny thing or it may be a big issue happening somewhere . the communication process should be clear whatever we write . this technique is useful to me . sometimes so many things comes to my mind , so many questions , many curses . so by this writing we can express what we thinking . other than that we can open our mind to public . there is no restrictions .
The legendary creature that scares me , but also amaze me its the werewolf . According to what people says werewolf are huge creatures , hungry for human meat . They only appear at full moon and they have sharp claws and fangs , a lot of strength and speed . If you find this creature by yourself you ll be dead in no time . If , somehow , you got scratched of bitten by this monster and survive you ll become one of them the next full moon . It is claimed that werewolves are servants of the devil and they need human meat to survive . I ve seen several drawing of werewolves . Some of them show these creatures as powerful hunters , looking for his next victim . But , some others the werewolves looks as a spiritual , wild and free creature that just walks away in this world . To be honest. I d like to be a werewolf : a different kind of werewolf that just walks in this world , exploring new places and be free . No ,. I wo nt kill people or other animals . I d rather just spend the rest of my life being a wild and free creature .
Buying a home or applying for a home loan are very difficult and time consuming processes in Germany . The country is famous for bureaucratism . Applicants for loans have to fill out a bulk of different forms . The purchase of a home requires similar conditions without any regard of the high prices in Germany . First of all , the monetary aspect should be considered . The prerequisite for getting granted a home loan is to have a high and reliable income . Additionally , banks control identity of a person , nationality , education level , family status and other characteristics . After having passed all criteria , Germans must pay high interest rates up to <num> or <num> percent annually . The next step is finding the appropriate home . The price for the estate is the most expensive part . For example , a <num> m ' ground in a suburb of Munich costs between <num> and <num> Euros . Therefore , many people try to buy an existing house , so they can save the money for building the house . The internet enables many useful searching machines for potential homes . Thus , most people relinquish to commission a real estate agent or mortgage broker .
Boris Becker 's new autobiography " Das Leben ist kein Spiel " was published a few months ago . It 's an awkward example for the total decline of a celebrity . Becker lost completely direction after finishing his tennis career in <num> ; since then he failed in most of his business affairs , committed fiscal fraud and forced the public to participate in his embarrassing relationships to Barbara , Sandy , Lilli a.s.o . He has become a media - hogging opportunist , who still believes to be a perfect ambassador for charity projects - unfortunately most sponsors determined the collaboration ! In his new book , Boris Becker wallows in self - pity ( " Barbara 's beaten me ! " ) and shows to be completely unable to reflect or criticize his own behavior . I hope , this time the public will realize the foolishness and blankness behind each sentence . Who can be interested in the constant exposure of personal defeats ? If. I was a fundraiser ,. I would never allow a character like Becker to represent my organization 's goals - the image damage would be too serious !
I do not want to name names , but there is a certain male singer who. I think is nothing but a media - hogging opportunist . He loves to champion the cause of Housing for Humanity , the charity that builds affordable homes for the poor , but. I know something that many people do not . A good friend of mine also volunteers at Housing for Humanity , and she saw this singer arrive the other day to supposedly work on the construction of a new home . He arrived with all sorts of assistants and media people . My friend said he did not hit one nail ! Granted , this guy donates a lot of money to the charity , but how hard is that for someone who is very wealthy ? My friend said he did not hit one nail ! Granted , this guy donates a lot of money to the charity , but how hard is that for someone who is very wealthy ? This guy was in work clothes and had tools on his belt so the media would report that he was constructing houses for poor people .
I do not want to name names . I would like to write the whole idea of celbrity in general . As my point of veiw , the main purpose for a person is to achieve success and become famous for revealing himself , without deviating from his beliefs . There are many examples in our life . People have already forgotten artists , sculptors , poets , writers who works only for money . And the works of those who invests the soul with the talent into their works will live forever . On the other hand , there are many really famous people , the whole world knows them . I think it is very hard to be famous : the press everywhere , they have no private life and only the strong spirit of celebrity can sustain such a life style . I would not want to be a celebrity , because it 's very difficult to be always in the limelight of the whole world . The notion of " celebrity " imposes before the man great responsibility not only for himself and his family , but also before humanity as a whole .

Unfortunately , robots have been performing more and more tasks , lately . This fact has been broadcast in the screen several times and. I was wondering that , maybe , once they really might take the control of our lifes . In fact , they have substituted ourselves as workers in assembly - line jobs because of their gain in productiveness and lower costs . Therefore , studying something at the university has even become more and more important these days in order to try to manage to do a job that robots have not been able to developed yet . In past times everybody could find a post in a factory easily because of the great demand of this kind of jobs . Human beings will have to be cautious and prepare ourlselves and be always able to be in a higher position than our rivals , the robots . I wish. I would not be witnessed of being slaves of robots . Although ,. I sort of think that we are already in bondage with. IT .
Robots help perform more than <num> , <num> surgeries per year in the US . They explore places humans can not , such as the deepest parts of oceans and space . But most often , robots perform routine , assembly - line jobs that increase productivity and lower costs , like packaging produce or attaching wheels to cars . Robots perform an increasingly large proportion of menial tasks in the US , which. I feel is a promising trend . The result is that companies can keep more jobs in the country and increase the number of jobs that require higher - level skills . Jobs that require these skills will still need to be performed by humans , at least in the foreseeable future . I think there is a major downside to this trend , however . As robots replace people doing manual work that can be completed by computers jobs usually held by poor and middle - class people the line that separates the poor and rich will become that much more evident . As this trend continues , we need to figure out how to add robots to create an optimal workforce instead of using them simply to replace humans .
Report for the Web - based magazine . I. Innovation about the international . I conference called " Robotic in 21st century " . We will compare the three most interesting kind of robots . First , we have the Escort robot . In the next five years , this robot will be a humanod with a emotional inteligence to help people with medical problem to work . Second , the Robot service . In the next ten years , this robot will help many people arround the world in medecine researchs and practises . And finaly , the Robot pet dog . In twenty , fifty years , this robot will be a emotionaly robot who will help people as a true dog . All this news inventions are interesting , and we can see that the . I is use to help people . And more than more , the robot will be humanods or will have emotionaly inteligence . We invent the perfect robots but we are human , and what is the limit ? Do not forget we can make mistakes , and robots will can dominate the humanity !
Determining which technique is the most useful is not easy because the effectiveness of each one is different according to the purpose we use it for or the goal we want to reach . I think we can divide these nine techniques into two major groups : metaphor , hyperbole and symbolism are writing techniques that allow people to express an idea in a more figurative way , underlining people 's thought or feeling toward a concept . On the contrary , free writing , focused free writing , loop writing , listing , questioning and cubing are six different techniques that help writers to find new ideas about a subject and organize them into a structured text . For what concerns my life ,. I would choose metaphor , on one side , and listing , on the other side , as the best techniques . During my scholastic career , listing has helped me to write down my thoughts , while metaphors has provided me a more creative and sensitive way to transform them into a perfect essay .
Court Green burglar arrested Local man arrested in connection with recent Court Green burglaries A 23-year - old man was arrested in the early morning today after being chased and cornered by police . The police is currently in custody answering questions about a lot of burglaries in and around the city during the last <num> months . The breakthrough came by a local resident , who called the police because the citizen saw someone acting suspiciously . Up to <num> houses and flats have been burgled . During the last months the police has made a lot of efforts to catch the burglar , e.g. extra police patrols in the area , undercover surveillance , a  <num> reward put up by the police for informations leading to arrest the subject . The nearby police caught him and now police held the subject in custody to answer questions . Police inspector Fred Miller said that the name of the subject will be said until the subject will be the burglar . But the public must wait until tomorrow , when the questioning will be ended . A local resident presumed that the spate of burglars will be ended with this catch , all neighbours are very happy about the catch.
The international . I conference called Robotics in the 21st century took place last week in San Francisco . Hiro Takashi , Bonnie and Major Pettigrew introduce new robots that would certainly change our life . Hiro Takashi is working with his team on robots with emotional intelligence . For the next <num> years , they will try to improve robots ' facial movement in order to make them look more human . He said that its a hard work but he seems very optimistic . He underlines the fact that robots have improved a lot in few years . Bonnie introduces a service robot , called Florence , which could be useful in medicine or heath area . For instance , Florence is able to help with monitoring and surveillance systems . And in few years she will be program to visit quarantine patients who are suffering from contagious diseases . Major Pettigrew is a military retired . He is now working on the leisure industry . He talked about the famous robot pet dogs and said that there is now international competition with this type of robots . By <num> , they will have developed a team of real humans .
In my country robots are being used by generally in big factories , like car industry . Recently Algortymic Trading is very popular . It 's still developing . Idea is . I will work behind your trading program and will decide which stock you should buy or sell according to market conditions . It 's very exciting idea among the traders . In my opinion including AT every kind of progress is dangerous directly for nature and also for human being as a result of destroying the nature . Therefore. I am against to every kind of progress . We have reached optimum tecnology for human benefits maybe in 1960's- <num> 's . Any new technology we developed seems usefull and harmless at the begining but after start to get used to use it and becoming an essential part of our lives we are looking for new developments . Every step we take to the future tech is step back in nature life ...
Well , let 's get started , and. I am very confident to talk about this because. I have done an acquisition last year . First you have to find a good real estate agent , someone that you trust . Maybe you should ask him or her for a coffee and try to get all information you can from them . Them , conduct a private conversation where you deliver the kind of real estate you are looking for , how much money you intend to invest , and what are the regions you would like to make spend your life . After that it is time to start seeking options . Do this as much as you can , see a lot of alternatives , even though the prices looks beyond your budget . It is good to create comparisson . Simultaneously , contact <num> o <num> banks of your trust , and ask them to create a loan proposal for you in order to have plenty time to bargain on interest rate . After choosing you ideal unity , and bargained with banks , hire a lawyer to help you out with documents and technichal issues . This would protect your investment in the future demands . And good luck with your journey .
Well , she is a very young woman who is very far away from my musical tastes . I had never heard of her before the latest years but , maybe , that is what. I hate the most . As far as. I know , she entered the world of famous when she was a child . She worked for a company related to the entertainment stuff for kids . She became a super - star among children and this company held her as a treasure . But alike it has happened with other young stars , she has grown up but she has not learnt to behave like an adult , at least when we talk about behaving in public .. Today she is a hack singer who craves to stay in the spotlight . Not to put too fine a point on it , she is rubbish . In my opinion she needs that someone would give her a piece of his mind , although it could be worthless . As soon as she sees the chance , she makes a scene . In a recent event it could be possible watching her on television during a performance in which she only was trying to arouse the audience . I presume , with the only purpose of appearing in the media.
While. I was thinking in picking up the best technique for writing ,. I just concluded that all of them are pretty good , depending on the type of paper work. I am going to develop . It is very important to consider all these technics , because if we only choose one of them , we are going to close our possibilities to creat great writing works . To explain this with more detail , lets think about a home work where your teacher is asking you to talk about a topic in the history class , for this work. I would suggest techniques with more freedom like free writing or loop writing because you need to be open to several ideas since the paper work you are going to develop has not to be narrow , it can be wide open in topics . On the other hand , lets imagine that you have been asked by your boss to make a report about the strengths of your department , at this situation you need to be very precise in the writing and you will need to use techniques more focused and specific as cubing and questioning . In conclusion ,. I strongly recommend you to have all these techniques ready to be applied according to the situation and the objective of your writing , with this approach you will have an arsenal filled up with great weapons to creat the most impressive paper works you never imagined.
The Golden Gate Bridge is a symbol of the San Francisco City in California . It is one of the most famous bridges of the world . It is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San francisco and the United States . When the city wants to start build the bridge , they have a lot of opposition from the city authorities and ferry companies . Although the idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate was no new , was made in <num> by former engineering student James Wilkins . However the designer was Joseph Strauss ,. Irving Morrow and Charles Ellis , and the Golden Gate Bridge began the construction in January <num> , <num> and finished in April <num> , <num> . The Golden Gate opening celebration began on May <num> , <num> , and the 50th anniversary was on May <num> <num> , also on May <num> , <num> tne city celebrated the 75th anniversary . The only bad thing of the Golden Gate Bridge is the suicides . More people die by suicide at the Golden Gate than at any other place in the world . The Golde Gate Bridge is one of the great engineering wonders of the world .
Actually ,. I am not very well know about the use of robots in my country but. I guess there are many machine arms being used in the factories , they makes the assembly line automatically work and accelerated the efficiency in producing , it 's great for the profit of businesses but maybe it also caused some unemployment in my country because it reduced the requirements for labors , the presidents in businesses would like to replace human workforce by machines ,. I do not know the exact impact but how to balance the business profit and unemployment rate in a key issue not only in my country but also in every well - developed country , the ideal situation is to develop some new cutting - age industries and get more technical workers by better education ,. I hope the technology will be better while the unemployment rate be lower , if we can achieve that goal ,. I think the robot will be a great welfare in my country .
It 's not easy to buy a home in my country , because recently the home prices became very high and unaffordable . Fortunately me and my wife has a very good income but it 's not enough to allow us buy a home without mortgage . Recently. I received a big cash from my father , that is gave me the idea to buy a nice house and use this money as a down payment . Before looking for a home , we had to sit down with a mortgage broker . We needed to be " pre - approved " for a home loan so we could actually make an offer on a home if we found one . The process was so complicated , requiring an incredible amount of paperwork , but fortunately with our good credit history we get the approval . We made a good research on a real estate web sites and we saw a big number of nice houses with a lot of pictures . At the end we found our dream house with nice courtyard and at our price range . Our offer was accepted by the real state agency and our dream became a reality in the end . Owning a home gave us a strong felling of stability and safety , it was really a good step in our life.
I think , charity is a very important thing , but. I heard about a male singer who. I think is nothing but a media . hopping opportunist . Housing for Humaity is the charity that builds homes for the poor . This is really affortable , but. I got something to know about that only few people know . This singer arrived the other day to suppsedly work on the construction of a new house by Housing for Humanity . A lot of media people and all sorts of assistants were with him . He was interviewed by the local media abut how important this charity was to him . After finishing this interviews , he left as soon as possible . My friend of mine , a volunteer at Housing for Humanitty told that story . This guy was in work clothes and he had tools on his belt , and the media would report , that he was constructing houses for poor people . Okay , he donates a lot of money but. I am sick and tired of celebraties .
The first robot , a service robot , has been built with the ability to display human emotions . It will probably look very much alike humans over the next <num> years . The second robot , which was considered to be a very dedicated robot , has been programmed to help with sanitary and social situations , such as picking up the trash in hospitals and helping in the charity field . It 's believed that over the next <num> years , it will be capable of visiting quarentine patients , and patients that who caught contagious diseases . The third and last robot has been developed as a sports robot , in the future it 's promised to play in teams like real humans . In my humble opinion , the most useful type of robot for us , humans , is the second one , because they can help us with sanitary issues , and also , by using them , we could treat patients who have caught contagious diseases and not catch their diseases .
Hiro Takashi is working with his team on anthropomorphic robots . He wants to develop a robot with emotional intelligence within next five years . Today robots are still artificial , instead he would like his robot to display happiness and sadness , depending on his emotions . Mr Takashi believes that is hard work , because programming requires many hours for the simplest facial expressions . His robot is not quite humanoid but it has some features of Homo Sapiens . Bonnie describes Florence , which is a service robot that picks up the trash in hospitals and helps with the works of security and surveillance system . During the next phase , researchers want to programme her to visit patients sufferings for contagious diseases . Maybe in the next future this robot will be taller than now . Major Pettigrew is involved in the development of a robot for the sport field , after he retired from the army . In particular he thinks that by <num> many robots will have substituted human players .
we know that all what we do not necessarily has to be sucessful so when things are going wrong here is where we got stressed and like everyone else. I have had stress in my life and just right now. I am having a little bit trying to write something interesting for a good grade ... Ok , when. I was at school. I had to do many things and homework and usually my grades were not the best so since. I was a kid. I was having a taste of stress . Now at college is worse but now. I am getting used to it so it 's normal to handle with stress and. I have a phrase that helps me a lot with everything , " everything will be ok if it 's not ok then it 's no the end " . I have some stress at work because. I have to handle so many things , and if. I do not do them well everything falls so you can imagine how. I feel when. I have to get up everyday , take a look , family , college , work and many many more things but. I am not complaining. I am so happy with my life with my family and everything is perfect for me ,. I tried to enjoy all what. I have and do and my family is the most important for me my engine ,. I love them everyday more because we are not everlasting and they are all what. I have here , So. I try to take advantage of every second with them and always Smile . .. YOLO ;)
I am not a writer but most of the time. I deal with business and technical correspondences and the techniques here are most often used as a tools to present a good letter . I used the " questioning " technique most often that. I have to admit that it 's been a usual concept in making a comprehensible letter . Technical writing has to be in concise method where you need to develop a feel organized pattern of attacking each condition and situation . Same manner in writing business correspondence where you have to be specific and directly point out the purpose and the underlying condition of the letter . Loop writing is sometimes being used correlating to the use of questioning technique . There are some condition wherein these two techniques are being used to present a more vivid and comprehensive writings . As there are some situation that requires looping to get through the proper ideas and concept of the letter . In this way , you are presenting not only a direct view of your intent but trying to explain further how things and situation came up . Reason by reason , you see what 's behind each question by going through the details of what makes everything fall into. Analyzing the emphasis of the paragraph by going through the details and summarizing the importance of the letter and thinking over if things had been properly discussed and disclosed , could give me strong sensible paragraph .
In Brazil , robots are only used in heavy prevents other countries and create your even for power generation , and he threatens to invade other countries that try to develop it , imagine if another country build a ". Iron Man " ? In return ,. I think that artificial intelligence could help us much in day- to - day and mostly on health , since many machines could process data in search of solutions to diseases such as cancer , . IDS , among others .
hi , for my environment i want peaceful and calming .. I think a paradise , like bahamas , where i can find paceaful . this is a country when i can find a clear sea and a beautiful sun , i can relax and reduce my stress . I want to go here .

NO MORE BURGLA. IES AROUND COURT GREEN A man , who was responsible for the crimes , was arrested this morning . After fifteen months investigation a 23-year - old male was arrested this morning in connection with a series of burglaries around Court Green area . The suspect is being held in custody and was questioned by police about the incidents , therefore this process include interviews with detective in charge of investigation and a local resident . He has not yet been named , but police are expected to release further information later . It is likely that he will be charged by end of tomorrow . After a lot efforts to catch him by extra police patrols in the area , undercover surveillance , publicity campaign by this local paper , and  <num> reward put up by police for information leading to his arrest . This arresting was only possible because a local resident called police saying he had seen somebody acting suspiciously . After that information police gave chase and eventually cornered him in Hamilton Road and arrested him at <num> am this morning .
Dear Sir or Madam ! I would like to suggest you to throw a brick at the Johnnie Oliviera . The most eminent feature of J. Oliviera is that his is now on the top of his career and very popular among viewers . We ca nt say the same about Vix N with her flagging career and despite her CV has very interesting details ( for example about drag addiction ) , it would be untimely to put the readers attention on her personality . As for Jacqueline Brody , she has brilliant experience of good acts toward children and adults and being famous right now she , from my opinion , does nt deserve to be badmouthed . Johnnie Oliviera is not just the most appropriate character from the list , but also has some alleged black spots on his reputation . So. I presume that we should attack him on the site because being a defender of healthy food in the media he supports the sails of sodium - laden chips across the Asian countries . I suppose this dishonest behavior is worth to be highlighted . Best Regards , Luba
Leprechauns have a long history as a part of. Irish folklore , and are considered to be very lucky , if reclusive , creatures . They are often pictured as very short , close to a child 's height with red hair and a red beard . They are usually shown wearing a green suit with pointed shoes .
One of the well - known legendary creatures today is the monster from Loch Ness , popularly called Nessie . It is believed to be living in the lake Loch Ness in Scotland . There are many eye witnesses talking about it and lots of photographs showing Nessie in various shapes and poses . During the years scientists have done several expeditions searching for this monster in the lake , but they have failed to find single credible evidence that it really exists . It is not a surprise though , since the lake is very <num> meters deep and the water is not very clear making it hard to search . For this reason the existence of the mysterious animal has been neither confirmed nor disregarded . In spite of that , Nessie has surely become a sort of a trademark of Scotland . Every year several thousand tourists visit the lake hoping they will see the monster . It became a tourist attraction and a source of income for people living in this area . What Nessie thinks of all this , we do nt know , but maybe she simply waits to be left in peace .
Stressful situations are increasingly present in people 's lives . Unfortunately , technological development contributes to the growth of the situations of concern . Formerly it was possible to go on holiday and switch off completely from work , there was no email , no cell phones or laptops . Today arrives communication anywhere , anytime , making it impossible to have effective vacation of professional activities . The truth is that technology should make life easier for people in order to have enough left over for leisure time , has made the free time become smaller . Several times. I preferred to postpone my vacation for fear that back had a ridiculous amount of emails . Given this reality the way. I found to combat stress is through the practice of sports , it makes me take the time to train and compete , since these times there is no way to read e - mail or answer the phone .
Robots are already used in many industries in Brazil . However , robotics is still very incipient here . Even though , it arises many questions and discussions : will robots take people 's jobs and increase social inequalities ? Wealth concentration is a very serious issue in Brazil and the mechanisation of agriculture has already been considered the cause of an structural increase in unemployment and , consequently , of a severe rural exodus . The latter , together with poor urbanisation planning , caused , and still causes , intense social tension and conflicts . May the replacement of human workforce by robots cause even more intense social tension ? We do not know the answer yet , but a similar process that occurred in England from the 16th to the 19th century might give us a hint : the Enclosures . This process pratically extinguished the " common lands " , which were fenced and entitled to one or more owners , causing an extreme rural exodus . However , the workforce that left the countryside , and whose means of survival was subsistence farming , was , then , able to work in the new industries of the. Industrial Revolution . Perhaps , it can be said that the Enclosures were " a blessing in disguise " and contributed to a new , maybe better , social organisation . How can we know that it wo not happen if robots really take some of our jobs?
We have robots mainly used for industrial purposes . For instance , they help to do really precise work which can not be done by human hands . Moreover , not having them for data storage or helping with scientific work would be a scary thought . Without mashines , we even have to wash the dishes ourselves . Rely on them became normal , not having them seems impossible but should not we worry a bit ? If you saw robot movies , for example where robots become evil and take over the world , you probably do not want to to see more of them in the near future . And since robots even can speak and teach children in Japan or being servants for korean households in the near future , the possibility of this worst case scenario seems even closer than ever . Here is one example . One day , Robot Bob brings you your medicine as usal . You trust him , treat him like your own family but on one day , Bob wo not show up . He will laugh at you and watching TV , while you will die without medicine . Ok that example is eventually is a little bit extrem but it shows , that people already are thinking about worst case scenarios . Maybe this prediction will never come true , but we will better wait and see. At least wifi and cell phones where parts of science fiction a few decades ago , right ? But here. I am , using my iphone via wifi to communicate with you .
Hello Tabby , First of all ,. I would  like to thanks you for your message . So ,. I know how is so difficult to write a good letter , for example , when we do not have way , key and others points . But ,. I am here to help you . You need some advices , and it 's quite import you get creative technique . First , Listing . You must write out in liner form a list of ideas .

Liner ways of putting down your ideas about a topic , a more random way of recording concepts . It you put up your visualize ideas . Final , the Cubing . Some writers do not like this technique because is confusing . But , you have to study . Then , it technique is six perspectives on a topic . Start by writing down a key word on a blank piece of paper ; put the word in a cube . Now , you have four creative techniques that it will help you when you will write your letter . Forget your fear . Thanks , Heilan Farias .
Our planet was severely changed since Marconi 's invention : the radio ( <num> ) . The electronic technology has boasting its over size road inspiring students to pursue careers in engineering , science , technology and mathematics through robotic designs . It 's impossible to imagine our country without this ' workers ' and its continuos upgrade . We are interacting with them all moments in all our life long . The computers are in the core and behind those strangers giants derricks digging the huge holes where in a few time we will come in a skyscraper to buy our last version of the mobile phone to watch those warps satellites are doing for us . Some robots are going to do hard tasks which the humans are not able to do like : walking on landmine , rescue people on a fire build or even stuck in the ice , feed wild animals ... the robots are not so limited regarding temperatures , smell , time and so on . The great disadvantage is about how expensive are the costs to invest in education , human resources and politics priorities . The robots are larger and larger with smaller and smaller pieces and amazing in their performance .
Robots have been doing a wide range of human tasks in Taiwan . They work in a assembly - line in a factory and do menial tasks such as vacuuming the house . In a hospital , they also help perform surgeries . We now have robots able to calculate , predict and catch the ball in a baseball court . Although robots are still following programs we give to them ,. I believe a thinking robot with the ability to reprogram themselves will soon happen . There is no doubt robot industry is still growing . In general ,. I hold a promising prospect toward this trend . Robots can help us save energies and produce an environment that is clean and less polluted . If we want a clean environment to live , we need these robots . And we need robots not only able to follow our programs , but able to rewrite programs . This means they will be able to talk with us and help us stop mishaps . The sci - fi movies already give us a picture of our future friends . However , as soon as they are able reprogram themselves , they are able to think , and even able to feel . If robots get emotions , it will be very dangerous to us . Despite of my positive attitude to our invention , there 's no doubt a worry behind it. But science has been finding its way to progress . We can not prevent . I to happen . However , we should control this application , and not allow it to be used in military purposes .
Looking ahead- . I innovations What robot have you been getting soon ? Its fantastic to imagine about it , it seems so far , but its near . For the next five years , a humanoid robot , a service one , it will show feelings , emotions , as sadness and happiness . What about a very dedicated robot that can pick the track up next <num> years ? There is more good news , if a person needs a treatment and has a contagious disease , a robot can help . Yes , a kind of doctor robot , good heath for all humankind ! That s marvelous ! But , we can admire some more yet , an industrial robot that can play sports , that s great , is nt that ? What about an international competition among robots in <num> ? Can you believe in these . I innovations ? Its only three types of robots ; you can keep imagining others kinds . Lets see soon ,. I believe ! I m waiting for your opinion , just access : www.web.basedmagazine See you next time ! Yours , Eliane Santana
Working and studying are probably the most stressful part of my life . Major stressor include deadliness , client relationships and travel . It 's so easy to feel like. I am caught in a trap , waking with the alarm , racing off the work and then coming home and study at night , only to collapse with exhaustion . Sometimes work stress is so overwhelming that is makes me feel all of my hope has run dry . Most fortunately , there 's a serene beautiful park next to our office . Every few hours ,. Ill take a break and walk around the park , breathing the fresh air , smelling the pine trees and taking in the soothing colours . Among the pines , we pick up the sweet sound of small birds as they sing and skip through the needles . A small waterfall spilling onto black stone further enchants the senses - and the imagination . The beautifula and attractive garden usually gives me such a sense of peace and wellbeing that. I can return to work refreshed and ready to give my best to the task ahead .
I have no idea how many robots are used in germany . I see the advantage to assemble them in the industry , where it is very dangerous for human beings . In production companies robots performe routine assembly line jobs to increase productivity and as a long goal to lower costs . But this is also a very bad trend because robots replace people doing manual work especially people with a low eduction . Robots work more accurate and precise than human person can do in specific areas like medical and technical . At the moment. I see a large increase for using robots in menial tasks for example in simple housekeeping services like vacuum cleaners . I see the future for robots as well in the entertainment sector , as a toy for kids and adults as well . The most important thing about using robots is to consider the advantages in comparison to the disadvantages by replacing humans . We have to keep in mind and think about qualified alternatives for human beings because they have emotions robots not .
Leprechauns have a long history as a part of. Irish folklore , and are considered to be very lucky , if reclusive , creatures . They are often pictured as very short , close to a child 's height , with red hair and a red beard . They are usually shown wearing green suit with pointed shoes . Legend has it that leprechauns hide all of their gold in pots at the end of rainbows , and those who can find it will be rich . It is also believed that if a human catches a leprechaun , the leprechaun has the power to gant three wishes to the human in exchange for letting him free . While there have been no reported sightings of leprechauns in modern times , these creatures are a common theme in children 's stories and are often mentioned at the sights of a rainbow . It is always interesting know about these folklore creatures and everything about my country 's cultures
After industrial revolution , many new technologies develop and make our life more convenient and comfortable . Especially many scientists and investors contribute to the robot research and manufacturing industry . We can see many robots have been manufactured and sold on the market . Take us of artificial intelligence , we can treat robots almost like human beings . There are three different kinds of robots we can see on the markets compared as follows : ( <num> ) service robot : The robot vacuum cleaner can clean your room rapidly and efficiently , it is one of the most popular domestic service robots on market . ( <num> ) industrial robot : This kind of robot can do many jobs people can not do . For example , if we need to assemble parts to make a car . We need to do it by robot because of the high - temp environment . ( <num> ) medicare robot : Some elder people do not have relative to take care of them . We can use robots that can express their emotions and message them , therefore elder people can feel they are not lonely and have a better feeling to live longer . Anyway , new developing technology on robots really help us to live in a more suitable environment , and make us happier than before .
Some years ago , here in Brazil , a famous actor discovered he was suffering from Leukaemia and he droped temporarily his career to be treated . he took about one and a half year to be cured . After that he started to work again he brace the Leukaemia cause and frequently he is taking part on advertisements for the cause without charging for that . Sometimes is good to take a shot in the arm . Another famous actrees discovered that her mother suffer of Alzheimer 's disease but she delayed to discover it and when they manage to discover it , the disease was in a very advanced phase . That day on she engage in the campaign to spread the early symptoms of the disease so many other people will be able to detected the illness in the initial symptoms . Of course she is not charging for that . On the other side of the fence , we have hundreds of pious that are in the media trying to take charity as they guideline to make mora money .

One of the legendary creatures in my country , Thailand , is the great Naga , which is popularly believed to exist in South and South East Asia . Great Nagas are gigantic snakes with crests on their heads and have beautiful , colourful scales . The belief in Nagas is originally from. India and is a part of Buddhist belief and culture . In Thailand , the legend has it that great Nagas live in the underwater realm , or Khong river , which flows through Thailand , Cambodia , and Myanmar . Nagas are believed to have great longevity , possess supernatural power , and can disguise themselves as humans . Many people try to prove the existence of Nagas by sighting and recording videos , but there is no solid proof that Nagas truly exist . There is a phenomenon that happens at the Khong river annually called Naga fireball . Every year , there are glowing , bright balls rising from the river which go high into the air . It is believed that the Nagas living there launch such balls from their mouth to pay homage to the Buddha in Nirvana . Interestingly , the phenomenon occurs on one of the important Buddha days .
AFTER A SE. IES OF BURGLA. IES , MAN. IS ARRESTED A 23-year - old man was arrested at <num> a.m. at Hamilton Road after a local resident called the police . The local police was looking for this young man that from <num> months was been acused of burglaries around Court Green . This was not a easy mission , it costed a lot and asked a lot of effort from the local police , which needed to ask for extra police patrols in the area , undercover surveillance , publicity campaign , and  <num> reward put up by police for information leading to his arrest . Asm was said before , all this effort lead the police to receive a call from a local resident talking about a suspiscious man nearby . It made the police go to the local and arrest the guy after been chased . At the moment the guy is under custody , wating for the interview with the detective . His hame was not revealed .
Robots are definitely awesome invention . They can be used in areas where humans arenot in the position to work . They can also work automatically and faster than the human labor force so that time , money and energy are saved . However , in social aspects and health centers ,. I would rather prefer the humans since they are more spontaneous , intelligent , caring and understanding than the robots .
Robots help perform more than <num> surgeries per year in the US . They explore places humans can not , such as the deepest parts of oceans and space . But most often , robots perform routine , assembly - line jobs that increase productivity and lower costs , like packaging produce or attaching wheels to cars . Robots perform an increasingly large proportion of menial tasks in the US , which. I feel is a promising trend . The result is that companies can keep more jobs in the country and increase the number of jobs that require higher - level skills . Jobs that require these skills will still need to be performed by humans , at least in the foresseable future . I think there is a major downside to this trend , however . As robots replace people doing manual work that can be completed by computers , job usually held by poor and middle - class people , the line that separates the poor and rich will become that much more evident . As this trend continues , we need to figure out how to add robots to create an optimal workforce instead of using them simply to replace humans .
What does it mean to be a celebrity ? The best answer know gossip columnists & tabloid hacks . To be serious. I can not agree that the idea of celebrity must be critisized because celebrities very often are ' products ' of our mass culture . Every historical epochs have their own heroes , their celebrities . It 's natural ! May be human societies need to have superstars & leaders ? ! But ofcourse there is a difference between world famous scientists or astronauts & pop - singers or actors who working for entertainment industry , earn big bucks because millions of media hogs desperatly crave after them . We feel sick and tired of such stars who pretending to be someone they are not . They always going on about their good deals , they call upon to the charity but rarely it 's not a double standarts policy . Charity for such media savvy celebrities is just a way to boost their flagging career . I would not like to be synic but to be charitable for many ' stars ' it 's nothing more then a public stunt . Celebrities are not the villains they just want to get on the bandwagon , like every one wants to be successfull .
In my country , there are several stories regarding urban legends , fables , fairy tales that are told from generation to generation . However , in my region , close from here , have a story at least intriguing . It is about a such witch that appears during the lent . The witnesses always are so convincing that. I sometimes believe in what they are saying . Once. I saw what the " witch " has caused in a farm near here . What happens is that the witch rides a horse and she make it run during the entire night . In the meantime , the witch performs a perfect braid in its horsehair and simultaneously she suck its blood . In the morning , the farm 's horses are almost dead . Like. I said , once. I saw what happened to a horse . It was a beautiful braid with signals of little hole on back . In addition , the horse was all wet of sweat . I was impressed . I donot know about the braid , but what. I think it is that was a bat sucked the horse 's blood and , in the attempt to get a rid of it , the horse ran a lot until the exhaustion . Mysteries ...
Robots are the way of the future . Simplyfying tasks or doing complex jobs robots have done great advancements for humankind . I sincerely think that robots will never surpass human beings in matters of instincts , emotions , an ability to read each situation and perform a great job but robots are ideally placed to help us perform a task , assignment or job in a much more efficient way . In my home country , Mexico , robotics are not as advanced as countries like Corea , Japan , China or the U.S. but there have been considerable investments in the research and development departments of universities and A. I. companies . I believe that it is critical for the mexican governement to increase funding to this proyects in order to make ground - breaking discoveries that could put us side to side with the greatest economies , not only in the A. I. field but in every field i mean think of the breakthroughs and discoveries we could achieve by developing superior technology .
I have busy life schedule and this includes work as a private tutor , two little children and a lot of house chores . Moreover sometimes. I have to do even more errands if my husband works till late night . As a result. I often get stressed and constantly need to de - stress . I do some special steps to recharge my batteries . First and utmost step is to allow my mind relax and have power nap during daytime and good night sleep . I helps me a lot and good night sleep enhances ability of my immune system to protect me from getting ill . Sleep also refreshes my mind and. I am full of ideas and creativity. I am able to give my students useful and meaningful lessons , as well . I can deal with household tasks easily too . However , if sleep does not help me a lot. I take another step . For instance. I go to romantic evening with my husband to a restaurant which is located near river bank . Sitting there on the balcony , hearing the sound of water and birds singing in the high trees makes me feeling of refreshing and extreme pleasure . The very next day. I am fool of energy and imagination.
At the moment robots are effectively non intelligent , now some may argue that they can already perform complex tasks at high speed with extreme accuracy . However you just need to stop and think about this for just a moment , all that is happening here is that they follow pre - written code . As we move forward coding will no doubt allow more complex tasks to be performed , but just because a robot can play chess to a very high level it does not mean it is intelligent , the program controlling it and the available computing power allow an evaluation of all the future permutations and assign a decision based on probable outcome . Robots performing tasks will have both positive and negative effects as we move forward into the future , on one hand they remove mundane mechanical efforts from humans but on the other hand they are slowly removing jobs traditionally performed by people or humans at the lower end of complexity , which always has the potential to be contentious . Unfortunately we are not all able to leverage the benefits from this to allow ourselves to make a more valuable contribution to society . Ultimately this is due more to our economic and politic standings which define our social status more than the real threat that a machine " can do better".. If you do not believe me look at the benefits that the railways have bought over the last <num> years as varying degrees of automation where introduced . If you need even more proof than that , think not only about the machines that help build an Airbus A380 , but also the flight deck computers that in real terms could fly the aircraft unassisted from between any two airports ( with a long enough runway and respective ground facilities ) in the world . Yes. I have exceeded the length specified but would you have rather. I left this to a machine to write ?
Robots are being used in many things in our country . In space researching it used wildly . mobile robots are found in military , industry and security environments . robots can also found in military applications . it is wildly used in space research center.scientist used this for finding new inventions underground and sea . Most often it is used in machines to assembly . domestic robots are used as servicing humans . it can help humans , in cleaning up and doing household jobs , then babysitting . they are used in some companies to smoothen their job . industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm and an end factor and that is attached to a fixed surface . some robots may recognize people or objects , talk , provide companionship , monitor environmental quality , respond to alarms , pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks . robots are used in packaging , loading and unloading things . in car production it is used for welding , glueing , painting , assembling . mining robots are designed to help in mining industry . robots are using in school as virtual tutors and teachers assistance . educational robots are using for help children to learn physics , mathematics , electronics and programing . There is also reading robots , it can read newspapers , find and correct misspelled words
I would like to introduce you i- robot , new invention of engineers and the first robot which was created to help people with household duties . I - robot capable of cleaning your flat in <num> hours , Unbelievable ! It really works ! The device is small and has a round form so you will not have problems with storage , Surprisingly i -robot learn the room before cleaning . Artificial intelligence ? ) I like the device very much , you could forget about sweeping .
Hi Tabby ,. I have just finished that assignment . You are saying you had writer 's block . In my humble opinion , it might not be defined as a writer 's block it must be something different . In other words , if you had taken some notes on this topic , you would not be stuck now . Anyway , never mind . I help you do the homework by sending the notes. I took . At last week 's lectures on this subject , four different creative writing techniques were mentioned , those are : Listing , Mind - Mapping , Questioning and Cubing . Listing :. It is a very simple technique . If you have to write an essay and have some difficulties , you simply write out a list of ideas in linear form not worrying about grammar , as you put down your ideas as bullet point , or numerical points . Mind - Mapping :. It is non linear way of putting down your ideas about a topic . You start by writing down a key word on a piece of paper . Then you respond to that word in the form of subheadings . You may use arrows to show relationships between them . I will send the other part of my notes by the next email . Cheers , Amelia
When. I m at a natural landscape , as a waterfall ,. I feel like the whole world ended there . I mean , its as if not exist anything else .. I hear the natural sounds there , like the water falling , the birds and the wind . Its absolutely refreshing and relaxing , because they represent the nature in its pure state in middle of the urbanization . I close my eyes and. I feel like. I m in the most tranquil place around the world . The grass is soft and covers all the area with its bright green color . The hours pass and. I can watch an amazing sunset though the rainbow above the waterfall . At this moment ,. I can see a lot of birds flying , doing loops in front of the sun , making a beautiful scene . At night when the stars appear ,. I close my eyes again and make a wish , feeling all nature power around me . These sensations are unique , impossible to describe using words . This place relax me specially because of the sounds , but the smell and wind are unbelievable as well .
BigFoot is simple a legend or it does really exists ? In this short assigment. I will try to give an answer to this question . Bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape - like creature , ranging between <num> feet tall , weighing in excess of <num> pounds , and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair . Alleged witnesses have described large eyes , a pronounced brow ridge , and a large , low - set forehead : a sort of giant apes which lived alone on the mountains and which was able to eluding the man . Some people tell that they have seen the monster as Eric Shipton in <num> . He was not able to photograph the monster but take a picture of a giant footporint . Other people who can assure to have seen the monster are Albert Ostman which claimed to be attacked by the monster and Jennie Chapman who told that the monster approached her childrens . The major part of reporting comes from the upper west side of USA . Some scientists have found also some very strange hoaxes which are not attributable to any monkey so the legend continues ...
The Robots are equipped with a speaker , camera , and video screen . They connect to the. Internet over Wi - Fi and you activate them as well as control them remotely from a computer using just a web browser . In my country the robots are being used to provide increased efficiency to businesses . For example , business owners who are seeking to eliminate the hassles of long distance travel can employ the robot to keep their representatives at their best while interacting with faraway clients , or touring larger spaces . This , however , does not mean the robot is limited to enterprise and small business . A doctor could visit their patient from a remote location , and medical professionals could use the robot to collaborate more effectively to increase their level of patient care . Individuals who can not make it to a distant location can use robot to afford them an experience that is , geographically , out of reach , or those who are home bound could use robots to attend social gatherings , be they in or out - of - doors . They can also be used in education to allow sick students to still participate with their classmates in and out of the classroom , as well as allowing educators the ability to check in or give lectures when they are away from the classroom.
Im am not happy with this development ,. I miss all things , which are very joyful for human beings . It makes happy to work , for instance cooking or gardening . For the elderly people a robot may be helpful . But perhaps people may think . It 's not necessary to spend our time with old people , the robot will do it , and so there will exist less communication , less sympathy . For the case , that robots explore places , in which human beings can not work ,. I would agree to this development . But an important argument in my point of view is the problem of unemployment . I think , it 's a pity , that so many people in Europe and in the whole world are without work . Therefore we must do less work automaticlly , give everybody a chance to work , instead of having robots , which destroy the possibilities of human working . In my opinion the lower costs should not be an argument .
There are various history that do part of folklore of my country . One of them is the history about a snake of fire . During the day , the Boitat not see anything , but at night , he sees everything . Legend has it that one night the moon did not appear , nor the stars in the sky , was the darkness total . After a while , the sun also not came up and all was in darkness for several days . People living in the villages were starving and cold . To make matters worse , it started raining nonstop . The rain flooded everything and many animals eventually died . A snake that slept in a huge trunk awoke hungry and began to eat the eyes that glowed of dead animals . Some say they shone light due to the last day when the animals saw the sun . The snake ate very bright eyes that she was all bright as fire . The snake became a glowing monster , Boitat . They say Boitat scares people when they traveling in the woods at night . However , many believe the Boitat protect forests against fires . Anyway , if you find a Boitat , close your eyes .
From my point of view , robotics in Europe has a widespread use , especially in industry . I do not mean a robot that does the cleaning of the house and brings you coffee in the morning , although this type of use , and probably in the study . Robotics and replaced the people mainly in strenuous work and precision . I think for example to paint the car , handling of solvents and acids that are applied now only using the robots . All precision work such as welding special laser cuts of any material , high - precision milling . There are maggazini fully robotic storage managed by staff with a computer . And many other uses that you probably did not know about it . Of course the hand of man it takes forever , but less and less . And a good thing ? and a bad thing ? however , and a process that will not stop .
Some TV programs that simule a real life , like BBB , is very common around the world now a days and many people spend a lot of time watching it . In my opinion , this kind of program is the worst program at TV . No cultural information and without good examples to the society . Unfortunately , the major part of people are influence by the TV , mainly the poor people . I believe that participants , in this kind of program , are manipulated to catch audience , and they are available to do anything by money . So , the worst thing still is ; at the end of the program , the people that participated , became famous and idols for our children .
Family issues are the most stressful part of my life , next is work related . The major contributor includes financial issues , family problems , report deadlines , dealing with projects productivity issue and coping with backlogs . My daily routine to wake up so early and rush to work to deal with the project 's issues is very tiring and very exhausting . Coming home late and could't hardly eat due to exhaustion is causing me too way to say. I am not enjoying my life the way others do . Added to that is when. I am receiving not so good news from my home country which really making me no time to relax and feel uncomfortable in most of the week . What do. I do to relax ? I tend to use breathing technique and PMR . Though it does not last that long , but it helps me to rejuvenate awhile and ease the mental burdens and sufferings . A time to unwind during rest day helps a lot to overcome anxiety and stress . Sometimes ,. I use to stay in my room and use scented candles to cool the ambience and enjoy the moment of silence . listening to soulful music in mild tone helps me to refresh my mind. A relaxing massage sometimes helps to relax my body and mind . As much as possible. I try to avoid being in crowded place when. I find time to pamper myself . In these ways ,. I am helping myself to naturalize stresses .
Robots are being used today in medicine . A robot can be so precise that it would be a great tool for performing surgery with . Robots can do insisions that are so clean that a person would not be able to see the cut from a distance after it healed . Doctors would not have to fear of making the wrong insision or cutting too far . A robot would be programmed to cut a certain depth and place . Robots have been real helpful in researching . They have helped doctors excel in new discoveries and information . Robots are used in industrial factories . They help weld cars and parts together . Since their percission is so accurate when it comes to welding it looks like a proffesional did it . The nice thing is that robots are not bothered by the bright light or heat . So these machines can do more work then humans can . Robots are used for home entertainment and leasure . There are several home robot kits that people buy . Some kits make the robot follow a line or trace a line . Other robot kits are made so the robot can determine if it is on the table or on the floor and how far to go before it runs into the wall or off the table. These robots have light sensors and switch sensors . There are some robots that do house cleaning such as vacum the floor or serve other people . Pet robots mimic actual pets which provide people with entertainment . These pet robots can bark , roll - over , sit , and play with you .
Buying a property financed in my country is not a difficult task , since many financial institutions offer this possibility . However the interest rates charged are quite high when compared to other countries . Added to this , the price of property here is very high , which makes financing even with high interest rates , is the best solution for those who do not have enough savings . Another feature of the country is the huge social inequality not only in terms of income but also local . The difference in the value of properties in the same city reaches <num>  . The list of documents required to obtain loan is extensive , including identification documents , proof of income and even tax return . Public banks do not allow funding for those who already own a property , which. I think is great because it prevents use public money as an investment and speculation .
Being a citizen of Moscow , which is a densely - populated and fashinable place for many people , given its high quality of life and soared salaries ,. I can maintain that the housing issue is of utmost importance for the people living here . Due to high prices of residence . Moscovites have to resort to home loans and mortgages . As far as. I know , there exist various options as to the most appropriate scheme for an individual . Certainly , one should make an application to the bank , submit a plethora of relevant documents , including passport , employment confirmation , proof of bank savings . In turn , a bank investigates borrower 's track record with emphasis on a good or negative credit history . Then , having issued an approval , a bank creates a special unit for a person to deposit money in it . To stress , the percentange for a mortgage is substantially high in Russia , roughly over <num>  , and another issue to be taken into account is the down payment . The higher is the initial payment , the lesser is the cost of a loan . To recap , housing loans are markedly expensive in Russia , however people take it because of inevitability as renting an accomodation is as calpable as the mortgage.
An UFO is an unidentified flying object . Many people believe that an UFO is an extraterrestrial vehicle , but they are wrong ! Each flying object that appears on a radar without sending its data to the control tower is classified as UFO . Nevertheless , the main meaning of the acronym is nowadays related to aliens vehicles . Experts think that a lot of the objects called UFO are often parts of satellites or pieces of heavenly bodies ; moreover observers usually describe the presence of light all around the unidentified spot and , as a consequence , the identification of the object is more difficult . Evidence of the existence of unidentified flying objects has been reported by Latin writers and , among others , by authors of the Middle Ages . Someone is sure to have been kidnapped by aliens , but military authorities have decided to keep details secret and to release them only many years later . Are aliens among us ?
I am walking through an old forest of spruce . I can feel the thick and clammy moss beneth my bare feet . A small creek is rustling in the distance and birds are tweeting gentle . The humid air is filled with the fragrance of spruce needles . A few shafts of sunlight shine through the branches and clades of the spruce . As. I walk further mists begin to appear and a chill can be felt in the air . The small creek seems to be close .
I personally disagree with some particular celebrity because it is nonsense . Let consider charity action of most Singer who organize concerts for children or for people have . IDS , it is like those concerts are programmed to promote singer themselves . Why do not give these musicians their own money instead to organise a kind of concert ? With respect. I do not think that celebrities have few money so that they not able to support directly hospitals and medical research centres for medecins . Another celebrity especially those from Holywood make more show than help . Every time when one of them planning to help poor countries like in Ethiopia or Afghanistan number of camera operators are following them . Is that necessary ?
Here in Brazil we have so many legendary creature . There are in our popular cuture and someone are very famous all over the world . I will write about a one kid than is a popular creature in Brazil . His name is Saci Perer . He is just a black kid with a red cap and he had just one leg . He always show when we have funny situation or when we look a messy place . So we said : ". I think the Saci Perer was here " . People say that he leave in the forest and is not so easy to catched his . But if you put some dessert and wait you would be watched his . The start the magic is when you feel a big powerful wind and after this you probabily wait and can saw his . If you went to Brazil , try to see Saci Perer .
Observations themselves Change this Occur or not , appetite or eating more than usual . Consider themselves doing To ensure that it will not do anything to damage it . The action too soon Concluded that stress is not always badThe force of life , but the stress significantly . And accumulated for a long time have caused the illness . Both physical and mental Therefore , we should Find some way to relax Stress better

COURT GREEN ALLEGED BURGLAR CATCHED A 23-year - old male is being arrested in connection with series of robberies in Court Green , which took place there , the past <num> months . The police caught him this morning , however his name has not been unveiled yet . It has been a very hard and synchronized team management to catch him . The had to move extra police patrols in the area , undercover surveillance , the paid for publicity campaign by this local paper , and the police offered a  <num> reward for useful information to accomplish his capture . A local resident , Mr. Jason Cure called police when he saw from his bedroom 's window , a young man acting suspiciously in the street . The police arrived as soon as they received the alarm call and succeed to corner and chase him . It was a combined work by police and local residents and the arrest was done at <num> in the morning . One of them said that all neighbors were afraid to leave their homes on holiday for fear to find their houses empties at their returns . Detective O Heer said that currently the suspect is being questioning and he expects him to be charged by the end Of tomorrow. He added too , he is very proud for the cooperation of his team and the local people .
There are a lot of waves tales about UFOS . The US department takes this seriously this story . It seems there s a restricted zone named zone <num> in the Nevada desert and the US department had captured a lot UFOS who are imprisoned . Do nt ask me the question if this story is true or is just another unrealistic legend . Also a lot of people simple citizens continue to affirm that they have seen with their own eyes several UFOs flying in the sky and touch down near their house . There are also some people who talked directly without any translation to these UFOs . I think definitely ridiculous such belief but sometimes it can be useful to talk about these legends in order to let people using their mind and try to think if there are other kinds of living creatures around us . The real question is to whom benefits such legend ? I have never found the right answer and perhaps it depends on what country were living .
There are many different kinds of robots today . It is predicted that by <num> , all households will own a service robot . Looking ahead , by <num> scientists will have perfected humanoid robots . Three new sorts of robots have been spoken about from their developers : Hiro Takashi , Bonnie and Major Pettigrew . They speak about the type , current features , future developments and the expected date of development . The first one will take care of people . There was a long way from the first robot , Shaddy , to the robots they try to develop emotional intelligence : The ability to recognize and act on emotions in a rational way . It is hoped to develop even human features over the next five years . Bonnie speaks about Florence , a service robot . There was much research spent on sanitarian safe . The service robot takes care in medicine and health . Florence is able to pick up trash , it is known as a really dedicated robot . Soon it will be sitting on the sofa , smiling and winking . The third robot has been developed by Major Pettigrew , a retired military , and his team . They get involved in sports field competitions . The robot is a wide loved pet dog .
From the interview about the development of robots around the world we could hear about three different types of robots that are being developed around the world . One of these robots is a emotional robot which can understand and express some of the humans emotions and the asian team that is working on it are doing their best in order to make the robot express emotional faces . Following , we have a service robot developed by an african team to work at hospitals , for a while they just work picking the thrash up and in the surveillance system , but are being developed to be robots that will visit patients in quarantine and patients who suffer of contagious diseases . From an american team heard about a sports robot that min the future will be capable of playing in an entire team at the place of humans .
Writing is a form of art , even if you have to write , for example , a scientific article . Someone may write better than others , but there exist some very helpful techniques that compensate for lack of talent . Personally ,. I think that most useful technique is the metaphor . It suggest to the reader many different points of view with which he can analyze a fact in a way he could not have done with a simple and ordinary description of that fact . There are also some techiques that help you to be more creative . I am talking about listing or free writing . If you keep looking to a white sheet for hours with no idea what to write , you should try to list down some thoughts and then put them in a logical order : that is called listing and it is a good place to begin . If you are not able to get on , another useful technique is free writing . It means that you can start writing what is passing through your mind , not worrying about grammar . You can begin writing something not concerning the topic you have to write about ; then , gradually , you can turn your attention on your main topic and focus your writing just on it.
The Prices of real estate in my country is very high prices and it cost a lot for one person to buy a home and prepare it , Most of people can not buy a home by cash , They will going to get a bank loan . To get a home loan from bank is not easy thing , the Bank asking about filling a lot of forms , And the only available guarantee is the person work and he should work in a government sector to be able to get a bank loan . The interest in my country about <num>  but if you do not pay on time you will charged for accumulated interest . In my opinion Bank loans for anything is wasting ,. It put any person under pressure , thinking and fearing .
When. I think of celebrities in connection with the exercises. I have passed ,. I think of Audrey Hepburn , Karl - Heinz Bhm or U2 and especially Bono . They are celebrities who were or still are not only very good actors , actresses or singers but also personalities who did and still do social work . They could collect donations for a good purpose and also spend their own money . They are examples how one can make use of its celebrity in a positive way . And in my opinion the help of celebrities is especially useful and efficient because they have immediately the public 's attention . I am convinced that these celebrities are doing this for goodness . They are definitely no media - hogging opportunists . As far as. I have noticed them they are convinced in helping other people . They have realized that being celebrity means in a certain way also a responsibility to the society , especially the poor , ill and even starving people . I admire these celebrities . If there are media - hogging opportunists among the celebrities ,. I have obviously ignored them well .
I come from a developing country . There are not plenty robots . Even though the robots in the industry have affected the rate of unemployment in my country . It is quite impossible to compete against Robot .. In this case there is no fair competition . Robots took the job from people , who were not very qualified and those people lost their jobs forever . Some of them were still able to learn another profession . But in fact most of them did not have the financial resource to choose another way . I am convinced that innovation and technology should be achieved to improve our lives . On the other hand technology must be developed considering the social conditions and job market as well . Social issues deserve a high position in this discussion . I am convinced that a modern society should include all different aspects in its developments and not only the technology . There is no innovation in the marginalization of people .
Chupacabra literally means ' goat sucker ' in Spanish and it is literally doing that in many places around the world . The Chupacabra is a legendary creature that sucks the blood of farm animals , especially goats . According to eyewitnesses and video footage caught on this animal , it has canine features along with reptile scales and spines up and down its back . It stands <num> - <num> feet tall and hops like a kangaroo . Other features include a forked tongue , bulging eyes and long fangs . It is reported to hiss and screech when approached and it gives off a bad stench . Other witnesses say that its eyes glow red , which made them feel nauseous . The first known sighting was in <num> in Puerto Rico , where eight sheep were attacked and their blood sucked dry . The only wounds on the animals were puncture wounds . Months later in a nearby area , <num> animals were reported to be killed in the same fashion . There have been numerous sightings of these creatures all over the world , From as far north as Maine in the northern US , but most reports are in the southern part of the US and in Latin America .
Christ the Redeemer is a statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ; considered one of the largest statues in the world . It is <num> metres tall , including its <num> metres pedestal , and <num> metres wide . It weighs <num> tonnes , and is located at the peak of the Corcovado mountain in theTijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city . A symbol of Brazilian Christianity , the statue has become an icon for Rio de Janeiro and Brazil . It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone , and was built between <num> and <num> . The first time. I went there. I was really impressed with the amazing view from the top of the feet of the Christ , especially the lakes and beaches and mountains of city ! Its really breathtaking and one of the most spetcular views ever !
I want to present the three robots. I have heard in the presentation . The first one is Juan , he is a service robot , current feature to display intelligence emotional . The next five year will we have a robot that can have a small facial movement , so that robots does nt look like they need a medical problem . Number two is Florence is also a service robot , which can tell you information about Africa . But also work in a health and medicine area . It was developed from team around the world . Transport around hospital and help the patients . She really is a dedicated robot . In the future they will program her to take care more of patients and more opportunities for human contact with robot in the next ten years . The last one is a development robot in a different field , sport field . The name of a robot is Ped dog . In the year <num> they will have to develop intelligent to the point to play a real human , maybe the next generation will be the robots .
My country 's most important national symbol ? What defines a nation and it 's culture ? Well , definitely a melting pot of multiple elements including language , food , history , music , ... etc . In my point of view the combination of these different aspects define a national symbol . I am living in Germany and once a year there is a place the world focus on and the eyes of the world look - at Munich - the " Oktoberfest " . More than <num> million visitors drink more than <num> million litre of beer within <num> days ! But they do not only come because of the beer ! All elements of national culture are represented at these traditional festival . You see man and women wearing traditional clothes , singing traditional songs and can taste tradition food . I do believe that the Oktoberfest is one of the most important traditional elements in Germany and every visitor to Germany should try to see , taste and feel Germany from it 's very best at the Oktoberfest in Munich .
In Brazil there is a legend that can be considered national , this may be due to the size of the country . In each region there is a belief , but coincidentally none are confirmed . The most common are : Saci Perer , a boy with one leg and smoking pipe . Woman wearing white appears at night asking for a cigarette . Recently emerged that a new one had worldwide repercussions , it is the ET of Vargina , that would be an extra terrestrial being who appears in a country town . Obviously. I do not believe in any of them , but. I am very curious to know how such legends arise and lead people to ensure the existence of the same . I do not know if this is a mental illness or vocation to lie , because when you hear the story of these witnesses is possible to notice that they are serious and show believe what they say .
X - Y-3025 This robotical tecnology elevate our possibilities into a new dimension of speed , accuracy and flexibility . It can operate over larger working areas and connect the whole world . Several robots are able to treat simultaneously on the same complex task at completely different locations . They are able to communicate with each other to share their results and make the process more efficiently . Majestic 1977 The core piece of this tecnology is manufacturing . Manufacturing that consumes less energy with less waste , manufacturing that follows market demand into new corners of the world and finally manufacturing of new , usually more compact , versatile and cheaper products . This robical tecnology intigrates the ability of recombination , so that the robots are able to transform programmed knowledge in new contexts . These robots will be the our humanoid future 's designers . Funator LAX HW This robot , colorful and rich in design , is an ideal companion for our youngest . It guides our children targeted to explore its environment just as reasonable as joyful .
Robotics bears witnesses of human will of progress . Of course , any kind of controversial heats debates about this topic : it is not that simple to clearly establish what are the main purposes and limitis of Robotics . In my humble opionion , it would never be established at all . In my country , robots are mainly use in industry or in some special cutting edge hospital . They perform repetitive and menial works in order to increase productivity : men make many mistakes doing repetitive tasks . Anyway , there are many efficient research center specialized in Robotics and. I think it would not take a little time before all this acquired knowledge will be used to improve our way of life . In my opinion , even though artificial intelligence is making astonishing ameliorations , we wo not ever be able to produce robots with human feelings . I must strees that. I find very interesting trying to understand what are the mechanisms that produce feelings in human beings . However ,. I do not think that , event if we get these mechanisms , will be able to exploit this knowledge .

It is a milestone to have robots in the world . Robots can do many things instead of human beings . There are various kinds of robots in the world . Some may be used as the elderly care , others may be produced as indusrial purpose and so on . Hiro Takashi is a kind of intelligent and emotional robot . They may have sad or happy facial expressions . They can solve the medical problems . The second robot is Bonnie . Obviously she is dedicated with personality and is produced for the purpose of diseases . The last one is called Major Pettigrew which is a kind of indutrial robot . Major Pettigrew can be used in leisure entertainment , hospital or goverment . I am glad that this invention will solve the medical problems and offer human power in industry . Nowadays scientists are eagered to improve them to do more dedicated things . I hope that having this invention , the world will become better .
From my personal experience buying a home and applying for a home loan is rather difficult and there are a lot of forms to be filled . At the moment. I was applying for a home loan it seemed that banks were declining more loans than they had done in the past for some reason . Banks were generally not making it easy for people who were looking to purchase their first home and there were numerous checks that have to be made in order to be accepted . One of the important things. I had to prove is that. I had a clear credit history in the past period . Second important thing was to have had a stable employment in the last year . I also had to have two persons who accepted to guarantee to pay the debts to the bank in case that. I would not be able to for some reason . This last thing was the hardest and it was really not easy to find people who were willing to sign such an obligation . Good thing was that the interest rates were not high as they usually are , because it was a special offer by the bank .
Robots everywhere ? If you ask me , the idea of having a robot nearby terrifies me . I mean , what if that thing has a malfunction and attacks me instead of taking care of me or making chores ? I wonot like to be there . Also , as. I ve been reading robots are about to replace poor and middle class people . A lot of people will lose his job just because of them . But , on the other hand , there will be benefits about it . I mean , if robots do the hard work , people will spend more time with his family . Also , people will have to study harder to not be left behind . Regarding . I , well ,. I think it will need more research . I mean , robots can do better things than humans , regarding to quality . Even so , they lack of emotions . Robot can only imitate what people say or do . But they are not capable to feel or express emotions .
A trade agreement. I do not know to explain a trade agreement in my country . I never worry about it . I know that We pay by every products that We buy here , high tariffs . The government prevent that We buy products in the other countries . However the people buy too much products in the other countries by internet . Trade by internet has increased significantly since <num> ' years . It is easy and simply put , with credit card we buy cheap products . In fact , many times some products come in Brazil with problems . So , many person prefer to buy the products more expensive than domestically produced because it is more easy to exchange . Indeed ,. I know that when We buy in other countries We are not helping the our countey to grow . Mind you , We understand that is good to buy the products here but definitely pick what is better to me .
Talking about the traits of succesful people , i think it 's important to define what can be called succesful . For me succes simply means succeding at reaching your own goal . By that definition anyone could be considered a succesful person , only by reaching their own goals . But the general public doesnot use this definition to determine who can be considered succesful or not . Most would say making <num> figures and being influential in someway makes someone a succesful . The one i would  like to talk about is someone who can be considered succesful using both definition of succes . Andy " Reginald " Dinh used to play video games for a living . More specifically he used to play League of Legends competitively . Having been there from the beginning of the game he managed to found his own business and establishe a huge fanbase . I believe the thing that made him succeed was his passion for the game . For several years the only thing he did was League of Legends . He decidet not to pursue higher education for a video game . And the gamble paid of . As of right now he is on top of the game . His business is arguably the most succesful in the scene. Worth multiple millions of dollars and having the biggest fanbase .
When you come to South Korea , actually there are not that much things you have to be cereful cause we are open to foreign people and can under stand the cultural difference well . But let me tell you some etiquettes just in case . When you eat something with other people , you would  better not blow your nose . You can just excuse and go outside and do it . When we pay at a restaurant , usually VAT is included to the price so you do not have to give tips extra . We do not have tip culture that much , but if you really want to thank , you can do . There will be no one who do not like to be paid extra . When we greet each other especially if it was the first time we bend out back a little bit and then shake hands . When we drink we show respect to other people . For example , we pour alcohol to other people first and we grab the bottle with two hands . When we are invited to someone 's house , we usually buy something . If you do not know their taste , cake or wine will be good .

I live in Florence where there is the highest concentration of masterpieces in all over the world but as many wonderful are its buildings and churches . The Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo ( the city 's cathedral ) are the two buildings which dominate Florence 's skyline . Palazzo Vecchio is the Town Hall of Florence . This large Romanesque crenellated fortress palace ovelooks the square " Piazza della Signoria ". It was built in <num> and is linked to the Uffizi and Pitti Palace through " The Corridoio Vasariano " . Pitti Palace is a vast mainly Renaissance palace built in <num> while The Corridoio Vasariano is a long corridor passing above the Arno river that links the two buildings . The Uffizi hold the largest collection of masterpieces of all over the world . A fantastic concentrate of beauty ! The city 's cathedral named basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower is the main Church of Florence and is characterized by his incredible dome high over <num> metres engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. It was begun in <num> and completed in <num> . It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed ! The cathedral complex , located in Duomo square includes also the Baptistery and Giotto 's Campanile .
The investigation 's report outlining of mister Nelson 's murder . On August 31th <num> , at <num> pm in the evening , a crime had occured of the Nelson 's residence on Sherbrook # # street . From the first witnesses , a violent argue between Sabrina Nelson and her husband Dave Nelson had warned the neighbourhood . Seemingly , mister Thymottee Maclour the main witness was working on his computer during the events . He was downloading some files when suddenly he heard increasingly of maniacals scream from the kitchen of his neighbours overlooked his home . By the time , he leaned out his window and clearly saw the eventfull facts . The witness claimed that Dave Nelson furious lost his control , so hit Sabrina Nelson to her face . Therefore , madam Nelson heavily fell on the ground . Hence , she was upsetting and injured to her left arm because of the shock . Then , when she was raising herself up , she had clutched a knife layed on the table . Next , without any hesitation , she swiftly stabbed her husband to his chest . Ultimately , he deadly wounded and lost too much blood before the assistance reached him .
In my opinion green business is one of the most important things in the world . If a business is truly green , then. I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly . To be truly green , a business shoul consider using renewable energy , such as solar or wind power , or an office with a green roof . Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic , recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging . I do not go out of my way to buy green products , but. I will pay a lot more for certain items . It 's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood , and. I do not want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products . However ,. I am concerned about the food. I eat , so. I make sure to shop at green grocery stores . I will sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure. I am eating healthy food . Of course , you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green , which is why. I buy from companies. I know a lot about . We have to pay attention in them!
Good evening , everybody . At the time when the election for student council president approaches ,. I would like to introduce myself as one of the candidates . At first ,. I am going to speak a little bit about me , giving you a short background of important points of my life. I consider useful to help you make the better choice for the school . I had opportunity to work in Angola for a whole year , during a time when that country was facing an internal fighting between two main antagonic groups . For several occasions ,. I had to act as a referee who , after listening two contradictory arguments from two group of people , have to decide which group has more need to receive humanitarian relief . I can assure you that is not simple or even easy task to perform . But. I learnt from that experience that we always have something to share with our fellow mates . When. I look at our school needs ,. I see that we all can share our strenghts to planning a more realistic budget , directing money where we need the most .
Corporate social responsibility is a divisive issue . On the one hand companies have a huge impact on society and therefore they have to bear responsibility for the consequences of their activities . I'am thinking especially about the problem of pollution . If for example an oil company pollutes the oceans by its supertankers than of course it has to shoulder responsibility for all negative impacts of such an event on the environment . And this responsiblity goes even beyond legal issues , it 's an ethical question . Furthermore let 's have a look on the working conditions . In my opinion a company should pay reasonable wages to its workers and it should provide safe working standards , take care of a good working atmosphere and of course avoid such unethical issues like child labor , conditions dangerous to health or exploitation of labor . This is not only in the interest of the working people but as well it is for the benefit of the company itself because on one side only happy workers are good workers and besides keeping decent working standards is good for the company 's image . Even if you regard the common arguments against CSR like the objection that companies are responsible only towards their shareholders , for the stated reasons. I still think that companies do have a social responsibility.
Brazilian legal system is based on Civil Law and , unlike the countries that adopted Common Law , our Criminal Code stabilish a minimum and a maximum sanction for each crime that can be aggravated or mitigated , increased or decreased depending on the circumstances of the case . Anyone can check what 's the average punishment for crime A or crime B just by reading some articles of the Criminal Code . The juri is heard only in crimes that attempted against the life of one or more persons , so most of the cases is decides by a judge . Petty crimes usualy ends up in a fine or in providing services to the society , like cleaning up the town , delivering basic food baskets to some institution . However , the crime will never be erased from a person 's criminal record . The main reason for not erasing the crime from the criminal record is that in case of recidivism the punishment will no longer be so mild , so is a system based not in the hope of rehabilitation but in the warning of what 's going to happen if the individual commits another crime .
Our live in <num> . Let us project how our daily life will change in the next <num> years . All types of computer technologies will be essential part of our daily life . 90  of world population will use internet in some certain ways . This will surely make our life easier . People will make all their purchases online and it will reduce the number of traditional retailers dramatically . Most of the malls , boutiques and shops will disappear . Only the big warehouses will be existing in the similar way as they are now . People could build parks and other green zones instead of malls and shops . But , most of us will be to lazy for doing this . We will used to purchase online , communicating online , getting married online etc . Special types of " online caused " diseases will be the great problem of future healthcare system , like " computer - related caries " , " computer - related obesity " and " computer - related infertility " . The new times will have new advantages and new difficulties .
First thing. I want to profess is my gratitude for this opportunity to participate in your program of giving economical support to people like me . As soon as. I received your invitation about the scholarship. I have been searching for information in order to dissipate most of my doubts about what 's the best option for improving my English . The alternatives. I have evaluated are : on one hand we have the TOEFL program and on the other hand we have the TO. IC . Both of them have been developed to evaluate English proficiency where your skills in listening , reading , speaking and writing are tested . Both of them are useful as an excellent professional credential , being TOEFL used as a measurement of readiness for academic programs , and TO. IC used by companies to make decisions about recruiting , promoting and deploying employees overseas , as well as a demonstration of learning progress in corporate training programs . After my research ,. I have taken the decision to take the TO. IC since. I consider , and confide in making a good judgement , that this is a more complex and complete test .
Hi Bob , I am glad you decided to write to me about your intentions , it is probably a sign you know that your plans are wrong . Hopefully. I have a chance to convince you not to make a mistake . Do nt you realize that you are playing with fire , you had better think twice before getting involved with those guys . Furthermore , consider that in the case of recidivism the term will probably be heavier and longer ; if. I were you ,. I would not count on a short detection at the juvenile hall . Anyhow this is not the point , you should think about the fact that with this job , as you call it , you will harm somebody else , and even if successful will not settle you for your life , so you had better consider to put your life back on track again before something very bad happens . I am here to help if needed , you can count on me ! When can we meet and speak ? Cheers , ....

I firmly believe that we should use more solar power , in order to reduce the use of fossil fuels and take advantage of the sunshine all year round . To do that , we have a lot of surface space to install solar panels , such as rooftops and walls of our buildings , not to mention all the land in our city district that 's not being used for anything ! I think it 's a good idea to install solar panels on the roofs of residential homes . Residents can use solar energy for their kitchen appliances , such as mixers , microwaves and electric grills . They can save a lot of energy and therefore money and , producing locally our energy , we will be more indipendent ! Installation and maintainance costs are high , but they will be totally balanced by the fuel and money savings . Consider the following : costs for solar power stand around US <num> , but they will be shared among the whole community , which is currently spending over US 800,00/year for no - renewable energies ! If you do not care about money , think about your children 's health ! What are we waiting ?
Dear Sir ,. I am writing to you with regard to the final review of the advertising campaign for our new customer Century . Here enclosed you will find the image and the slogan. I choosed from those developed by our team . I selected the picture in the middle , representing the famous actress , because in my opinion it best suits our purposes . The image suggests an ambience of luxury and exclusiveness and the slogan " Your glamour ; your Century " connotes a certain affinity for a smart and stylish way of life . Since both the customer and the product have an estabilished image in the luxury segment of the market and we want to follow the current trend ,. I think this is the right message to catch the interest of potential buyers . I think our customer is not interested in addressing a wide range of consumers ,. I rather think his ideal buyer has a huge purchasing power and is keen to emphasise his whealth in showing that he can afford to buy status symbols . I am convinced , that the advertising campaign will hit the bullseye ! What do you think about it ?
CSR , is generally perceived as a positive business ideology and became popular in the 1960s . When you would ask people about their meaning of CSR , you would get very powerful arguments on both sides of the question , pros and cons . On the one hand , it can be argued that only people can have social responsibilities , corporations are only responsible to their shareholders and not to society as a whole . On the other hand , company 's factory pollutes the environment , why do not they should pay to clean it up ? Company 's are manufacturing their goods in countries far away , the laws in those countries are sometimes not at the same standard as they are in their own country , is it done with following those laws ? Why do not they should try to make this world a better place ? Personally. I think , a company has more repsponsibility than paying their taxes and following the law . If they decide to produce their goods in a country where they can get cheaper production costs and a bigger profit , they are responsible to provide fair pay and benefits , and give something back to the community , for me they are responsible to try to make this world a better place.
In my opinion the Amazon e - commerce site is one of the most famous and best websites . Amazon was one of the first companies which only specialized in e - commerce . Since the start of this website the Amercian company has created a unbelievable number of customers regularly buying online products via Amazon . The simplification and easy handling of the website is one of the great advantages of Amazon against other e - commerce companies . After opening the website the user sees all available links at one spot : The searching maschine , the log - in button or the navigation line of all different commodities . The handling is for new customers easy and quickly understandable too . Another pro of the e - commerce site is the diversification . Amazon offers almost every commodity . The range of products is about food , clothes , electronic devices , plants , books and many other categories . That 's one reason why so many customers first of all open the Amazon website in order to buy something . Last but not least the payment process is easy and fast . For customers with a membership it needs only three or four clicks and the purchase is carried out . A delivery within one or two days is standard.
When. I have to mention who is the successful person that. I adore most ,. I could say he is B.J.Habibie . Even though he 's an. Indonesian , he spent most of his life in Germany to become a plane engineer . Not only the smartest person in. Indonesia , he 's also the most inspired human in my country . He was the third president of. Indonesia that has the shortest term of office , only from <num> to <num> . Most people thought that he was a technocrat instead of a politician , thus they doubted him being a president . However , in his reign , he made a lot of changes in my country . Unfortunately , he resigned after <num> days holding the power for being a president because lots of people dislike him and try to made him down . I guess it was the worst mistake that have happened in my country , because if only Mr. Habibie still became a president , my country would have been better now . Habibie is not only smart , but also wise that he always use his conscience to do anything . Moreover , he has a really nice wife that always beside him whatever happens . He 's really a true definition of a successful person.
Dear Bobby , t hank you for your letter , but you should better think twice , the easy way is not always the best way . In my opinion it would be much better if you ke p t going to school . With A - levels you will have much better chances of getting a good job or even getting into university . Odd jobs or criminal activities will not really help you in the long run . You need a good education for a stable job in the future . I know that it is not easy with your social background , but if you decide for a good education now , this will help you in future . I suggest that is what you should really stugggle for . If your parents can not afford it , you might get help from some other sources like education funds . A bright young man like you should not waste their talents . I recommend you stay out of trouble and stop playing with fire . your concerned friend Kate

Solar power As. I live in So Paulo , Brazil , the best renewable power source for my city is the solar power . Although the costs are high , there are sun and heat for almost <num> months a year . This is a vertical city , where solar panels can be installed . The maintance costs are high ( cleaning , short circuits , corrosion ) , but the benifts for using them would overcome any price . There would be no waste of this energy . It would be even better if all buildings change their glass walls , so we do not need to use so much air conditioning , as glass retains all heat . The main idea is to install these panels to provide eletricity to the building and lower the use of hydropower energy . In Brazil , most of energy is provided by hydropower , but we do not have space enough to create these dams to generate eletricity . We need to use other resources not to damage nature anymore .
It 's a pleasure and an honor to be here . I am concerned about my responsability on representing all of you and becomes our school a better and pleasure place to be , to learn and to make friends for all of our lives . I know exactly what we need first ! One of my priorities as a council president is to develop the students involvement in sporting events . It does not matter to study and be the best at school , if we do not take care of our bodies ! Everybody knows how important is to have healthy head and body . I also know that you are in a good age to practice sports and be classified for competitions with other schools . So , that will be the opportunity ! As my priority number two is to avoid high spending of money , buying books every year .. I will introduce a way to lend books for all students and , at the end of the year , these students will give them back to the school in order to lend them again to the next scholar group . If the books are kept in a good condition , nobody will be without books and the school will be engaged to renew them each time a new edition is launched.. I will also study programs to coach teachers , giving them skills to change their classes into interesting activities to set better the knowledge . That 's all for now . I am counting on your vote and. I expect to make our dreams come true . Thank you !
The person is very persistent in what he does . He 's a very active person , with lots of energy and a serious person when at work . Also at work he takes good care of his staff and cares about them . He 's a straordinary father and a very good husband . He goes straight to the point when doing something , so let 's say he 's a well decided person . He does not have wonderful ideas , but the ideas he have , the puts them in action very fast as he knows exactly what to do . He is a model person to be followed because of his traits , the way he works and the way he lives . In my opinion he was a very competitive person in everything he does , and that 's a good thing , because he is always trying to win or be the best . In one way , he is a very successful person as i have described .
So Paulo is known for its terrible traffic , interesting people and stressed out entrepreneurs . The city has many gray ordinary buildings ... But there are some places. I would recommend visiting . The Casa Modernista is definitely one . The architect wanted to create a economic , functional and aesthetically pleasant house . It 's actually very similar to the powerpuff girls ' house . That 's why. I adore it . Another building is the Hotel Unique by the architect Ruy Ohtake , son of Tomie Ohtake , a very important artist . And it surely does deserve that name for its unique architecture . It looks like a giant dark modern ship stuck in the middle of the city . It 's located near some of the best malls and business centers . Finally ,. I could not talk about So Paulo 's architecture without mentioning a visionary man , Oscar Niermeyer . He projected Brasilia ( the capital ) and some important buildings in So Paulo . The Edifcio Copan is one of them , an odd building that looks like a beige ribbon fluttering in the wind . It 's an interesting building , but people say it 's not so good to live in . Well , that was Niermeyer 's style : always sacrificing use to look , but still getting amazing results.
Well ,. I am going to write about elementary school , in Brazil we have two kinds of elementary school : private school and public school . Unfortenatelly , we have so many differences between both of them . Students do not need to pay anything in a public school , the government is responsible for everything , in other words , public school works with public money . In a private school is different , the students have to pay to have classes in a private schools without any help of government . Usually , rich students goes to private schools and students who do not have a lot of money goes to public schools . This situation is very complicated because private elementary schools in Brazil is much better than public schools . The government do not invests enough in public schools ( besides that we have the corruption problem ) , the teachers in public school are not so good as teachers from private schools . So what 's happen ? You can imagine ... students from private school leaves the elementary school with a better teaching , consequently , they get the best jobs and the vicious circle keeps running in my country .
In Latin America , there are one according among four countries , called " MERCOSUL " . The acronym means : " Market Common South " . This pact is formed by the following countries : Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay . The main goal as well as the Eurozone , is the free trade between these countries , besides another 's goals like : adopt one trade common policy , policy coordination and areas harmonization . The MERCOSUL emerged on <num> , December and beyond the member countries , others countries support the according like : Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela and Peru . This pact is somewhat interesting , because help these countries on Economy and consequently to do grow the Economy inside each country . As well as other , e.g. , NAFTA and Eurozone , the MERCOSUL is a great model of policy successful . Of course , we are not a world potency , but we are becoming respect 's countries . Brazil is a good example , already that is in the media , across events like " World Cup on <num> " and " Olympics on <num> " .
There are definitely both pros and cons associated with big - box stores , but. I think we have to be realistic about the circumstances of some communities . They also cause existing , smaller businesses to go bankrupt . Furthermore ,. I would like to point out the impact these big - box stores have on our environment . There will be a lot more traffic , congestion , pollution and over dependence on cars and superhighways . On the one hand , these stores improve the lives of many citizens . Big - box stores provide consumers with convenient , one - stop shopping at low prices and apparently boost the local economy . But on the other hand , more big - box stores will destroy the community and change the living environment . I want to repeat my assertion that the arrival of more big - box stores in the area will change the lives drastically and. I am not sure that it will be for the better .
Bank in Paris robbed by magicians in Las Vegas- A show hold in MGM Grand at Las Vegas was the place to steal a Bank in France . Las night show at the MGM Grand at Las Vegas , Nevada , presented how the Four Knights , magicians , stolen the Capital Bank in Paris , France . With more than five hundred persons in the show , the presenters showed all the people how they transport to Paris and draw the money out the bank . The magicians hypnotized a person from the public and sent him by teletransportation to Paris , he appeared just inside the vault , and he took the money and brought it back to the MGM Grand . But the robbery did not finish there , after the person came back through the teletransportation machine , it started raining money in the whole theater , so the audience could get some euros to take to home . F. I and. Interpol are performing an investigation about the case when they found that the Capital Bank of Paris actually was stolen , so they are interviewing every one of the four magicians to solve this case and get the responsible for it . Reporting at Las Vegas , Nevada ; Everardo Hernandez Sagarnaga .
There are definitely both pros and cons about big - box stores . I am against the construction of big - box store , but. I understand the argument that big - box stores provide consummers with convenient , one - stop shopping at low prices and boost the local economy . However , it 's common knowledge that big - box stores cause existing , smaller businesses to go bankrupt . Furthermore , big - box stores are almost always located in the suburbs of the big cities , so the construction of big - box stores do not benefit people who do not have a car or can not drive to the big - box stores . Before. I got slipped disk ,. I enjoyed shopping at a big - box store because of its sheer volume and a broad variety of products . However , now. I can not walk and drive without feeling pain and discomfort ,. I began to shop at a small grocery store near my home . Compared with the big - box store , it may not have a variety of products , but. I am satisfied with the quality of the products . I must stress that we should not accept the construction of big - box stores without serious concern about our future . What will you do if you get older and have to give up your driver 's license , and find no store around your home.

Hello John , I am writing you in order to advice you of the endangered and extinct animals , called " giraffes " . These animals are most widespread in East Africa and the northern part of Southern Africa . It would be very fine if you can produce some nice cards of giraffes with the slogan " Lovely giraffes - the world 's tallest animals " . We are very pleased to hand over these cards to families with children , kindergardens and different schools . Herewith , our aim is to make children aware of the giraffes from extinction and to give them a chance to live in free areas in Africa or whereelse . These cards can be used as games for children , also as learning materials in biology lessons in different kind of schools . I think these cards will be a good seller because most of people are interested in protecting rare animals from extinction and life in big zoos everywhere of the world . I hope you have copyright of the giraffes ' pictures . Is it possible to use these ones in other packs ? This is what. I prefer . Hoping the costs will be similar or less than our last product , called " Animals of the Africa continent " . In case you need an editor ,. I can support you . You should know that. I have many experience from the African animals . I propose to meet you , John , in the next week and discuss more details about these new cards . I am looking forward to hear from you . Thanks .

Once. I had dealt with the work stress ,. I focused on the home environment . There were many things that. I had not thought would be sources of stress , like the many pieces of large furniture that swallowed up my bedroom and living room . I also had a very sterile looking flat . No photos or artwork on the walls and little memorabilia on my bookshelves . I found some items from my travels around the world and put them out where. I could see them . I filled the house with green plants , changed my bedroom furniture to lighter pieces , and painted the walls a soothing light blue . Now , as. I walk into my house , even after a very busy day ,. I feel instantly comforted and at peace . Time management : have a schedule ; keep a list of things to do and put the most important things at the top . Focus on effective methods : think about which methods you have used effectively to combat stress ; take more exercise ; talk to friends and relatives for advice .

Hey Bobby ,. I must say ,. I am highly alarmed by your email and. I urge you to talk to me in person before you hurl yourself into trouble with these ' guys ' . Let me tell you up front : These people are not ' cool ' and if you really think you are just gon na do a few ' jobs ' for them , think again ! Once you are in the claws of those thugs , you will have a heck of a problem getting your life back together ever again ! So you spent some time in juvenile detention - that does not mean the ' straight - and - narrow ' is forever lost . You may be afraid to go back to school now , but let me tell you : once you have been in prison ( and that 's irrevocably where you will end up if you keep playing with fire ) it will be a lot harder to get back on track afterwards . If you really can not stand the idea of going to a regular school , we could check out one of those special programs . Think about it ! You would  better believe me : The ' easy way ' wo not get you anywhere in life ! Call me !
If you are looking for the appartment of your dreams , the one wich will make you feel in the best shape for years , you have to consider this . Imagine Pacific Heights , such a quiet and cute setting is not it ? Imagine then coming back home after work , tired and stressed by the day you have just spent , and imagine now the peace you could find at home . The appartment counts three spacious bedrooms with splendid views on trees , birds and sky . There is two bathrooms , so if you have children , they wo not have to get in your own private space where you could as you want , take a peacefully bath or a dynamic shower . You can access to these rooms by using the original wood staircase . Text Uncorrected by Teacher due to Word Limit : The kitchen has been remodeled in a modern style , with a stainless steel backsplash and granite counters . The walls in the whole appartment have been hand - painted in white in order to feel as calm as possible . No matter , if you prefer , you could also put colors in there . Then , when you get outside , you can appreciate the sight of the rustic porch in front of the house wich seems itself neat and tidy . You can live in this little paradise for  <num> per month .
The buildings are not attractive in my city . There are a lot of apartments . I guess that the tallest building has <num> - <num> story .. I think that people do not like to live an high . You can not see green place between this boring buildings also . In Ankara and. Istanbul there are higher buildings . I think they are almost 50- story but Turkey buildings can not race with Tokyo or Dubai within the category of highest building . I want to live in a high building as <num> . floor .. It will be fascinating and also you will near by God . But you are far way to people , trees .
Indeed , it is really interesting to explore what traits make people successful . But what success is actually means different things to different people at different stairs of their life . In my opinion , success is not only running an own business , not only making money , not only setting up power and influence . These are the measurable elements of success . What. I am really interested in is the social side of this phenomena . As success is always defined by personal goals you must have the ability to postulate your desires , your vision very strongly . You must think that you have actually earned more than you currently have . So you can force a severe illness . So you can make the world a little bit different . You wo nt give up even if you are hit by heavy strokes . It is easy to make the right decision , because you do nt have any doubts in yourself .

But first of all thank all of you who helped me planning the party to make it unforgettable ! And the best is , we all can share this day with the couple . So now , let me tell you a story how. I get to know Doug . It was quite funny , at least. I did not know his was dating Jessica , though he is such a honest and loyal guy . The perfect bridegroom for my sensitive and easy - going daughter . Little wonder as a couple they are so affectionated and devoted . Now they they are together for three years . They are just Lynda and. I used to be . Finally ,. I want to wish for both of you that your love will grow constantly. Cheers .
Good Morning . My name is. Isabelle Machado and. I am here to present you my campaign for student council president . First of all let me say some words about myself . I am a regular student just like you . I am not the first in class . But. I am the most devoted to this purpose . I hope to make some significant effects on our learning environment . I will not rest until. I get us a new and remodel library . A place where we can go and enjoy the pleasure of reading a book . Also. I will propose a different method of teaching showing that practical classes are a great way to learn . I know we can do more for the less fortunate students . Let 's show them that the school can be a great place to be . I hope to count on you to help me with these tasks and together we can built a better school . Thank you all .
I foresee a future where almost all the tasks done by humans will be considered to replace ones by robots . For example , robots will clean up our house , not only floors but also windows , kitchen sink , bathtub , etc . In fridge , there will be a web camera , which will inform us which ingredients are in . We will know what we should buy that day even in the outside . Shopping will be much easier than now . What we will do is just choosing things by internet . Things will be delivered to our house on the same day we ordered . Well , in my vision of the future where people will be lazy so that we are unlikely to cook by ourselves . Well -balanced meal delivery service will be much familiar with us . Some weak points , such as parallel parking or putting a car into a small garage will be no problems , because auto - driving system will be a standard . Auto - pilot can prevent any serious accidents caused by human errors . It seems to become a rosy future , unless we have a disaster , such as blackout or breakdown of internet . Besides , for whatever goes wrong , we will have to keep our skills as we can do now .
I believe that companies have a high responsibility to society , in my point of view : what you take you must give back . For instance , when the business of the company goes through by " damaging " nature ( woods , water 's , etc ) they are being sellfish to the point of preventing others from using those resources as well . Currently. I'am working in a quarry as Admistrative Director , a while back ago. I was asked if my company could help the city where it stands since the people on the town are always being disturbed by the noise from the blastings and do not complain at all . Unfortunately , the CEO does not care about CSR ,. I have tried to prove my point of view and show that the minimum he could do was give a little to the community . CSR dosent need to involve money at all , you can give back to community just by only opening a bore hole for water or maybe constructing a playground to the childrens . Well ,. I wo not give up , maybe one day their eyes will open ,
In the company that. I work for , recently we had this new director coming here to take care of our business ( he came from another country ) and he likes cycling . So he asked if there was anybody him could ride bicycle with , especially to show him the place and stuff . So people introduced him to a guy who works with us for a very long time . He is nt a boss or anything like that , just an analyst who also liked cycling . They went to ride bicycle until the east coast ( its like a <num> hours trip ) , chatting and everything - and when they arrived there , after drink something and appreciate the ocean view , the directors chauffeur came to pick them ! ! ! Imagine how cool was that ! ! !. It turns out they became very close friends and everybody is jealous kkkkk
On Monday evening at 5:00am , hurricane alfred hit in a very strong way in scharet , Cancun . with 110mpb destroying everything in its path . that 's why many types of help are required in order to put under a calm . As. I told you before everything was almost destroy so we volunteers who make the debris removal . Many people were injured so donating bloods are very necessary . In order to everybody receive help , we need people who is willing to gather supplies and volunteers for administrative work as well . After the disaster a lot of people lose their homes and businessman lost their factores we would also like to people who is wiiling to help in costruction work . Let 's join to face this hurricane , if  have the disposistion to help , everything is going to be under control soon . Please we need as many volunteers as possible .
When. I started to think about people that. I admire and find successful ,. I notice that did not have necessarily a lot of money and were not famous . I think that we have to distinguish between personal sucess and profissional sucess . In order to have profissional success and make Money , you must follow your goals no matter what . But , personal success depends of what you do in you life to make it better every day . Certainly you should be passionate about your work and should have new challenges every day , but keeping in mind however , that work is a part of your life , but its not your whole life . So , be successful is to be happy , you must enjoy your work and also to be connected to people , to have friends , to give attention to family , take care of your health and to value simple things .
Now let me talk about a great source of environmentally friendly energy : tidal energy . Everyone knows how solar panels or wind farms can help a city to generate renewable energy and reduce its consumption of fossil energy . But fewer are the ones aware of the earnings provided by the tidal energy . This is a form of hydro power that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power . Tidal waves move water into power turbines and that kinetic energy gets converted into electric energy . This could be a really useful source of power , considering the fact we are living in an island surrounded by an ocean . We have strong tides very often and we should definitely take advantage of it . Moreover , this solution has a relatively low cost and a low ecological impact . It will only cost the city <num> USD to install tidal systems , which is much cheaper than installing solar panels throughout the city . It is actually half the price of a solar installation for the same amount of power generated . In my opinion , it is the best solution for our city .
To the attention of the CEO I have selected the first picture . This picture represents a modern tendancy because some people are interest in their beauty , health and fit . Fighting against the oldness is opened so. I appreciate this picture . We can notice also that the woman is holding a flower in her hand and , this one symbolizes beauty . Moreover ,. I think that this picture may catch the audience 's eye . It 's a fabulous eye - catching . About the slogan ,. I think that we can say : beautiful like a flower . What do you think about that ? Indeed , century is timeless beauty , therefore , this picture might meet a big success . Thirdly , about the target :. I think about the woman aged between <num> and <num> years old . Futhermore , about the spreading 's ways : we can advertise some posters in the streets , all the more , broascasting some pots on Tv and internet . we can deliver some papers to the people also . Do let me know , if you are agree or not ? I think that this project will be successful , wo not it ? Looking forward to hearing from you Best Regards

Yesterday , there was a protest againt the govern and the directers of the two main universities of the country . The students and professors wanted the right of vote to choose the director by direct elections . Here this is not possible because the University Constitution is from military period . One protester was gunshot by a police officer . He is at hospital now , but he will be fine . The institution of Police is also from military period , so we have many problems about the acts of polices . Well , backing to the protest . The students made a camping in the director 's office and are living there untill he hear them , is such a terrible situation because there is not another way to make the director talks to the students or workers . I am not sure if is a good ideia to vote to director , but. I am pretty sure , we have to be listened and this is a huge change to be heard !
I have some statistics. I d like to show you : The research shows : 15- to 19-year - old women in comparison to 18- to 24-year - old males . 29  of women purchase at least one magazine a month in comparison to <num>  men purchase at least one magazine a month . 69  of women prefer magazines to blogs in comparison to <num>  men prefer magazines with extensive website content . The competition : <num> competitive products already exist on women group while <num> long term and <num> recent competitive products exist on male 's group . The purchase power : The woman group showed  <num> billion in <num> and an ( estimated ) increase to  <num> billion in <num> . The males group showed a lower estimated raise from  <num> billion in <num> to  <num> billion in <num> . Demographic size : The woman group was <num> million in <num> and in <num> ( estimated ) <num> million while male 's group was <num> million in <num> and decrease to <num> million ( estimated ) in <num> . The research shows that the woman 's group has a better demographic size and more competition while male 's group has a better purchasing power .
You can see two demografic group with different purchasing habits . First one , 15- to 19-year old women . Despite the estimated rise of this demografic group its purchasing power is not big and competition for this group is strong enough ( <num> competitive products already exist ) . Second group are 18- to 24- year old men . They have more purchasing power and they are more loyal to magazines ( <num>  purchase at least one magazine a month ) . This demografic group prefer magazines supported by extensive website content - and we just have perfectly designed website . And most important thing : we have only three competitive products for this group and two from three recently present on the market . Based on these data we can assume that the second group is our focus group . Despite of projected decrease of this demographic group their purchasing power should be practically stable . I recommend to concentrate our efforts on the second group .
This story happened with my friend several years ago . She decided to spend her holiday traveling over Europe by car . You will never believe this , but in her first destination in Poland she crashed her car . But she followed her dreams and continued her trip by train . Her next destination was Germany , Berlin . She could easily reach it by train . She bought a ticket and went to the railway station , sit at the train and there she realised that she messed up date : she bought a ticket for next day instead of this day . So , she bought another ticket and finally arrived in Berlin . Her friends should have met her at the railway station but they did not come . She realised that she forgot her mobile phone in the train . But , suddenly she saw her collegue and good friend and hurried up to him . He waited for a train , but after she explained her situation he cancalled his meeting , helped her to find her friends and was her guide during the rest of her trip .
Dear Mr. Nantakam ,. I am writing to update you on our progress . I am sure you will be glad to know that we have tested the samples and determined that the quality is excellent . Although we identified an issue with some of the packaging materials , we immediately fixed it . Marketing then sent the samples to seven key partners for further testing . Once we receive the feedback , we will develop several marketing campaigns for your review . We plan to mail the materials to you on July 15th ; alternatively , you could visit our headquarters after July <num> to discuss them . In either case , it 's critical that we receive your comments by July <num> . I can arrange a meeting for you and Mr. Salas to touch base the week of August 8th . Could you let me know whether that works for you ? Please contact me with any concerns . Best regards , Lauren Reese
I believe that in <num> years ' time , the technology And the bads things is not stop on that ,. I think the relationships are been decreasing in the next years . Today , we donot talk to each other . We only talk with text message , facebook or email . We donot said to the other how we feel , what we prefer and we want to have a good time with the others . We are so addic to the technology that we donot look around , help people or see a beautiful lady near us . We donot pay attetion to the human feelllings . So in <num> years ' we will became a robot with no feellings or likes to be together . I think we only pay attention with our cellphone or tablet and we only do what they said to us .
Dear Mayor Bleak ,. I am writing to you to express my concerns about Super - Mart being built in our area . I really think that it will destroy our community and change our way of living together . Proponents of big marts argue that these stores will improve the lives of many citizens . Shopping marts provide consumers with convenient , one - stop shopping at low prices and apparently boost the local economy by revitalizing low - income neighborhoods . However , it is common knowledge that marts cause existing , smaller businesses to go bankrupt and their employees are being paid minimum wage and have no social or health benefits . Further ,. I would like to point out the impact a mart may have on our environment . There will be a lot more traffic , congestion , pollution and overdependence on cars and superhighways . And have you thought about people who do not have a car or can not drive to the big superstores ? What will happen to them ? I want to reiterate that the arrival of Super - Mart in our area will change our lives drastically and. I am not sure that it will be for the better . Yours sincerely , CarmenL

Solar power . Our country benefits of a favourable weather : mostly sunny , with acceptable temperatures also in winter . That 's the reason why. I can easily say that solar power would be the most effective form of renewable energy for our city . Energy from the sun , thanks to solar panels that can absorb solar energy from sun 's rays , can get converted into thermal or electrical energy . I suggest to install high quality solar panels : it will be expensive but it will be an investment for our future and the future of our children . We will face also quite high maintenance costs ( cleaning , short circuits , cracks , corrosion ) and the city will pay most of the money , about  <num> . As far. I am concerned we will demonstrate in few months the advantages of using solar power : we will also attract turists that will help the growth of our economy . Thanks a lot for your attention .
Green business is very important to the environment . If all the companys and people buy those products , we will reduce environmental degradation . For exemplo : they should recycle plastic cups , towel paper . Companys should do more for the environment and the goverment has to supervise if they protect and no pollute . Use renewable energy , solar or wind power . Teach how to buy green products and show how is healthy . All people somehow pollute the environment and they have to learn how reduce environments impacts . , use a natural resources as much as possible by using organic , recycled and biodegrdable materials in their products and packaging . I do not go out of my way to buy green products , it 's not easy to find a place whose sell truly green products . I always buy in the supermarketing and pay more for those products . We have to educate the world to use a green product and we can save the future .
I think most people would agree that successcul people are passionate , persistent and probabaly pretty competitive . You should be able to learn that skill if you want more sucess in your , your life and your relationship . However ,. It does'nt promises you the succes . I think you also need to have a great idea or some kinf of vision that nobody else has . I really admire David Laroche , it 's a person who shares some videos on Youtube to improve your next days . It 's calls " wakeupcalls " , he wants to motivate you everyday and set your goal , your dream that you inside yout heart !
The emergence of big - box stores model was due to the pace of life in society , in which people now have less time as needed to balance work with personal life . The bad traffic also hindered the availability of time . Given this situation , the possibility of having a retail where one could find all the products was spectacular . The need for a larger space , as it needs to have a good assortment of products , this type of retail usually be located away from the city center . Another feature of the big - box stores is the best price . Despite all these benefits , some critics appear on this retail model , especially in relation to the injury suffered by the small business . It is a coherent argument , however it is necessary to analyze the distance from the big box in relation to residential areas make the small business is a solution for shopping more often , even with a smaller volume .
The Eupopean Union was founded to protect the european countries against another war in european teratory .. In <num> , the individual currency coins and notes were changed to a european currency , the Euro . So the eurozone got a lot stronger , with only a single currency . The EU was creating a single market , that streghtend up in worldwide trade . An added plus was , they became more powerful and were able to play hardball with the USA and China . But there are still a lot people in all this different countries , which are skeptical about the EU . The are afraid , loosing their individual face . By loosing their own currency , they might be loosing , their own culture and heritage too . Nowadays there are lots of financial problems with members of the EU . There are added european laws , supporters of the EU say that 's a progress . I by myself think , time will show us .

In Brazil the native language is Portuguese . Its the biggest country of the world that speaks Portuguese . Nevertheless , the Portuguese spoken in Brazil and Portugal has differences . A few years ago , in order to avoid the growing of the differences , a new orthographic agreement was signed between the countries that speaks Portuguese . However , if the people are intending to visit Brazil , be aware of studying the Brazilian Portuguese rather than simply Portuguese . The Brazils dimensions and the immigration process occurred from many different parts of the world are responsible for creating a large number of accents in different countrys areas . Thus , sometimes , due to the different gestures , words , slang and conversation rhythm , even for Brazilian people who are traveling through the country , listening to the locals conversation seems like hearing another language . Anyway , the visitors should not not be worried about it because the Brazilian people will make all the efforts in order to understand them .
A green business is the one that exercises its activity in harmony with environment , that is , in a sustainable way ( using renewable resources , using recycled and biodegradable materials , etc ) . A green business does not contribute to harm the environment and , sometimes , it helps to improve its deteriorated health . We all , not only companies but also individuals , have to change our mind and , as a result , our behaviour regarding the environment . Otherwise , the result will be a horrible place to live . But. I am very skeptical about the claims of some companies regarding being green . I do not take the word for it because sometimes they only want to offer a good image to the public to increase sales . Therefore ,. I prefer to check the information . As for me ,. I am afraid. I do not go out of my way to buy green products . Lack of time is the main reason . I do not buy green products , either , if the price increases a lot . I think. I have to change my mind to be more compromised in this respect .
My physiological needs are well covered . I have access to adequate food , water , a place to sleep , etc . My goal is to maintain this state throughout my life .

My goal is that. I want to reach employment stability over the next years and increase my savings to improve my finanical security . Love / Belonging :. I am married and my main goal is that. I can maintain a happy marriage throughout my life . My needs in terms of a loving partner and family are met , but. I would live to gain more friends in the near future . Esteem : My needs here are partly met through an interesting job . I hope. I can maintain this . I would like to gain more self - confidence in the next time and get more recognition in non - work environments . Self - actualization :. I believe. I know well who. I am , but there is always room for improvement.

The market urge for green products , but are all products called " green " really environmental friendly ? I think that there are two types of green companies : the ones who are really concerned about their impact on the environment and the ones who pretend being green in order to sell the products to the huge part of the customers who are able to pay more for a green product . In my opinion , there are also two kinds of customers : some are really concerned about the environment they live in , while others are just keen on the environmental hype / trend . I normally do not go out of my way to buy green products , but when. I want to buy something that 's called " green " ,. I do a small research about the company and the product to know a little more about it . In my opinion , the best we can do to help the environment is reduce the amount of unnecessary things we buy everyday ! I do not agree that people who use ecobags but buy <num> cellphones each year ( there are a lot of them over here ) are really helping the environment in someway .
Dear Paula :. I have read your letter and. I have some good news for you . First of all , it is interesting to mention that you are aware of the difficult financial situation and concerned by its dimension . This is perhaps one of the most difficult barriers to evercome when personal finances change . Taking into account your spendings habits , and particularly focusing in food costs ,. I would suggest the three following ideas : 1.-Change your breakfast habits : A healthy breakfast at home , including fruits , cereals and a coffe will be cost saving for you , and will give you more energy during the morning . 2.-Prepare the lunch at home and eat it at work . Again , this will be cheaper . Furthermore , if you try to eat more vegetables and fruits , this will result in a healthier lunch . 3.-Eventually , you can enjoy a drink with your friends . But prepare the dinner at home and become a good chief!. A good home - made dinner will be a great surprise for your friends . Finally , it would be very usefull if you could write and follow a weekly budget . Try to progressively cut costs by avoiding unnecesary expenses and also , try to content with simpler things . Good luck ! Javier
Petty crimes in Russia include shoplifting , hooliganism , disorderly conduct , purse - snatching and many others . There are a lot of different punishments : fines , house arrest , forced labor and so on . If you are sentenced to jail for a petty crime , you might be fined or if it is recidivism you might be incarcerated . If it was drunk driving , you will lose your driving license . Youth aged <num> - <num> are sent to special schools or they have to work for some hours for social needs : cleaning rubbish from the streets , sweeping and working around school . Youth aged <num> are fined or sent to prison . After punishment , many petty crimes can be erased from a person 's criminal record so that the individual can lead a normal life . Generally , petty crime is considered less serious . The court delivers a minor punishment mainly so that individual will admit he or she has made a mistake and think twice before committing another crime . The hope is that a person will be rehabilitated .
In Brazil the enterprises who focus on sustainability are growing faster and faster . The new concept of green business means that one enterprise needs to fill some criteria , for instance , principles of sustainability into each business decisions , produce products environmentally friendly , among others . In my point of view this is the way to improve our quality of life . The Government needs to invest in advertisements , developing awareness environment campaigns to achieve a critical mass and on this basis prepare the youth population to obtain a better relation with the environmental . Teach then to reuse products , to recycle waste , to use biodegradable products are some ways to succeed these goals . In my opinion if each one of us doing our part , is the beginning of a new life . I try to do my part when. I separate waste , buy green products , use renewable power as solar and hydropower energy . If everyone adopts the right attitude we can change our future .
The historic architecture of Bruges , in Belgium , is marvelous . The city is well - known for its Gothic buildings , with their pointed arches and celebratory spires , built in roughly betwen the 13th and 16th centuries . Some of the most exquisite buildings are centered around Market Square , the heart of the city . If you visit Brugues ,. I recommend you stay in the Grand Hotel Casselbergh , an 18th century building with a contemporary wing that blens in a beautifully . The hotel is conveniently situated in the center of the old city . Near the Casselbergh is the fabulous City Hall , the oldest city hall in Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg . There 's also the Church of Our Lady , which houses a lovely Michelangelo sculpture and is also the tallest building in the city . The spire itself is <num> meters ! There is one modern building worth mentioning : the somewhat overwhelming Concertgebouw , a concert hall . Although. I am pleased the city decided to construct something that reflects the current time , the building itself is not all that inspiring , in my opinion . Overall , however ,.

I think that a successful person has to be , at least , honest . If one is honest , all the other traits are easier to be gathered . So , one should try hard no to get out of the ethics parameters . Obvious , it is not easy . It is also important to pay attention to the impact of your actions to others . You should always think of the consequences of your positions . If you are in doubt if it will have some negative consequences to anybody , it is not probably the best way to act . Being admired it not that easy , although . The admired person become an example for the admirer , that reproduces all the behavior of the admired . So , important people may be aware of this responsibility . Indeed , it has to have discipline in everything that you do . Because , if you commit an error , so all your image can be damaged forever . And , many times , you have only one opportunity in life .
If we want to have a successful future we have to study more about the market . Lets look at some pros and cons for the two target groups . The women target group is 15-to-19-years - old and the men target group is 18-to-24-years - old . There is <num>  purchase one magazine a month from women group , in contrast , <num>  from men group . However , both groups are nearly <num>  expressed huge interests to see more information on internet . There are <num> competitive products already exist in women market , in comparison , only <num> competitive products in male market , one exist long time and two others entered into this market recently . If we look at purchasing power from <num> to <num> , we can find out that female market will rise dramatically , and the men market is going to be a only slight rise For the demographic size from <num> to <num> , on the one hand women demographic will increase <num> million , on the other hand men demographic is going to fall about <num> million .
Today many companies as well as scholars in the universities deal with how people 's lives will be different in <num> years from now . They think that technology will provide a comfortable life to all people . I would like to discuss this view . In fact ,. I am not a technology opponent . I accept that technology has changed human life , in which home life , transportation and environment . I do not want a person who is not in the loop technology . I believe technology is very useful for us to improve our life , so. I would like to get with the technological programs . However , there is a big question stemming from the word " ALL people . " I wonder whether or not everbody can benefit of technological developments . What is the most important problem of the world ? Technological developments or poverty ? According to me , poverty is much more important issue of today 's world , and the real matter is to eliminate the poverty . We should focus on this problem and ask ourselves : Do we really want to find out solutions for the poverty , or do we just would like to develop techonology because of making money? As Nietzche said , " what is the real motivation of this act ? "
Dear Paula ,. I am glad that you finally found a new job ! I am sure together we can easily change some of your habits and considerably cut your expenses . The food habits you described me are very consumer - ways to eat ! Have you ever calculated how much do all of the ready - made foods and drinks that you buy cost you in a whole month ? You are aware that you should change those habits and you are asking me some advices . Well ,. I would suggest , instead of buying takeaway coffee , why do not you bring it from home in a Thermos ? Likely , would not it be possible to bring a lunch - box on midday instead of having your food from the street ? It might also be healthier ! Last , it could be a good idea to invite your friends at home , and let them invite you instead of going every evening to the restaurant . Believe me , if you indeed modify your life style , not only will your bank account get fit , but you will also appreciate more the things you will get with your money ! Good luck , Your Coach
The way. I look at it , hydroelectricity is going to be more effective than any other nature source energy . It fits to our city 's energy needs . Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower ; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water . Water resource will be enough , in my opinion . Our city is close to the South - East costal areas . The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The building and maintenance costs would be low . The average cost is  <num> . Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed , the project produces no direct waste , and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) than fossil fuel powered energy plants . In a word ,. I am a firm believer in hydroelectricity . It would be the most environmentally friendly method to produce renewable energy for our city .

The traits. I admire about our CEO are his discipline at work , his excellent knowledge about our business in detail , his analytical skills and his ability to anticipate future developments . And although these competencies should be self - evident in his position , it is well worth to be mentioned . It is very inspiring to work with him as he lets all team members participate in discussions about the companies goals which gives us the feeling that we are all part of the success and make contribution to it . With this habits he demonstrates excellent leadership skills and we can learn a lot from him . He gives a good example that failures are not the end of the world , but that failures are always a chance for all of us to improve and learn . He understands to give even inferiors the impression to be an important member of the company . Without being pretentious he sticks to his goals and motivates us all . On the contrary , he behaves in a humble way as if he would know that the success is always the result of the group and stems not only from one single person .
Dear Mr. Smith , Thank you very much for your inquiry about business etiquette in Japan . Punctuality is very important . If you are late for an appointment , please make a phone call . If possible , tell us how late you will be and why you will be late . Japanese people avoid physical contact . We do not even shake hands . So , please just bow when you meet someone . If you try to hug someone , you may be misunderstood to love the person . It is customary to exchange business cards just after we meet each other . Please put the business card you just received on the desk or table until you leave the room . Do not feel awkward when you see most Japanese people do not use many body gestures . Some people do not use even facial expressions , especially when they are happy . You may think we have poker faces , but it is a part of our culture . If you have any questions , please contact me at any time . We look forward to seeing you and doing business with you . Sincerely , Takako Nomura
TOEFL and TO. IC - Two tests , one goal. In this article , we will know the main characteristics of each exam and whom it is applies . TOEFL exams is one of most applied tests in several countries to evaluate English proficiency for academic studies . This exam is used by institutions of higher education to screen students for scholarship and exchange programs . TO. IC exams is one of most applied tests in several countries to evaluate English proficiency for global workplace . This exam is used by companies to making decisions about recruiting , promoting and deploying employees overseas and it is used by English language programs and schools as a placement test for business - oriented students . Both exams measure communications abilities such as listening , speaking , writing and reading and they are used as professional credential . TO.

I am an employee in a Multinational Company and at the same time , a graduate student . However , anyone of them are worth to do and they will open doors in your career .
It is very difficult to write about traits of successful people , because it will depend on the activity performed . I think that honesty , intelligence , resilience traits are very important to achieve success . However , when analyzing the political , we found that most of them are not so honest . Already a professional career traits. I mentioned above are fundamental , but increased proactivity and passion for what he does . Indeed , passion is a necessary ingredient for any activity , the difficulty is to share this passion between personal and professional life . Another point to be considered is the culture of each activity , which may differ and require different traits . The very moment the economy can also influence the demand for traits that are considered important to achieve success . Because of everything that was written earlier ,. I think there is a recipe to get to success , which is good because it gives everyone an opportunity to get there , just find the opportunity .
Corporate social responsibility impacts the environment , consumers , employees and communities . So , companies have a moral responsibility to give back to society . Nevertheless , there are powerful arguments on both sides of the issue . CSR proved to be a divisive issue in the board meeting . On the one hand , it can be argued that corporations owe nothing to society other than running their businesses , paying taxes and following the laws of the country . The job of taking care of society is for the government . People do not ask politicians to make products , so why should we ask companies to solve society 's problems ? On the other hand , companies have a big impact on society . If a company 's factory pollutes the environment , then it should pay to clean it up . If a company hires workers , it should provide fair pay and benefits . Companies can also help the communities where they operate . Many consumers are too sophisticated to fall for a publicity stunt like CSR . Some shareholders are not convinced that CSR is such a good idea . After all , that community is letting them do business there . It 's a two - way street .
Dear Mayor Bleak , I am writing to you to express my opposition and from neighborhood association about the arrival of the new superstore . In a last survey you could see that <num>  of our people are against it . In our city we have the life of a village with small store . The people know each other . We have good social behaviour . We could open our self store . The salary is better than in our system . We are afraid that this arrival could destroy this good harmony . On the one hand the price of the furniture would decreased but on the other hand the social price is two heavy for the community . A futher consideration is with this superstore will come car and people from other town . That could case pollution and many social trouble . I want to reiterate my request , do not given this authorization . I remind you what 's happens in the past at the city neighboring . Yours sincerely , Bob st clair .
To the attention of Mr. John Smith . Among these three proposals ,. I have chosen the first picture representing a charming woman next to a colorful flower . As far as. I am concerned , this image can absolutely describe the aim of our company : timeless beauty as a value which can be compared to our stunning watches that last forever ! Thanks to their materials and assembly , these watches can captivate a wider audience 's target than our competitors and that 's why we should bright all of these magnificent characteristics . How can we do that ? I propose you to begin with a fabulous party organized in a splendid scenery that shakes all the guest 's souls in order to invest in our advertising campaign . After that , we can publicize our product by TV and radios ads or even by billboards enhancing the chosen picture . I hope that you can find my proposal suitable for the campaign . Let me know , Your sincerely Matteo Mascia
As far as. I am concerned , big - box stores are destroying our community and they are changing the way of living together . On the one hand , these boxes improve the lives of many citizens by providing them with convenient one - stop shopping at low prices . According to this circumstance , the local economy is boosted by revitalizing low - income neighborhoods . One the other hand , big - box stores practice substandard labor practices and they cause existing smaller businesses to go bust . Furthermore ,. I would like to point out the impact of our environment : an increase of traffic , congestion , extreme pollution and overdependence of cars and superhighways . From my point of view , superstores are not the answer for my community . Nevertheless , some other communities would profit by establishing big - box stores because they have different circumstances and different needs though .

Once ,. I was asked what success means to me . I remember that. I answered that for me was having a good job with responsibilities , being with my family and achieve my dreams . Fifteen years later ,. I can say that. I understand my boss ' advice . Happiness and success are closely related . If you are happy with your life , you can say that you are a successful person , no matter what 's your job or how much you earn . After. I got married and became a mother. I also understood that sharing happiness was a key to success . It 's important to celebrate the achievements with people you love . I could mention a lot of famous personalities that are considered successful . It would be Maddona , Bill Gates , Giselle Bundchen , Mark Zuckeberg etc . They all have a lot in common , they became rich and are passionate with their work . For me being successful in your work life is important because you spend most of your time at work . But ,. I think that the main reason that makes me a successful person is my personal life . I can feel that in every smile of my daughter and husband , being loved as a mother and wife . That 's why. I believe that happiness and success are closely related. You are successful if you feel happy .

Best regards , Jesus Sanchez
Successful people are a mystery . There are many different ways to achieve success but. I think some few characteristics are common to them . First. I guess successful people must be resilient and persistent , because sometimes the success comes after one or several failures . Second , these people are always passionate and competitive . But why we know a lot of people that have these traits however are not successful ? Perhaps you need a little luck or they have an different idea that the other people do not have . Everyone seems agree that when we think about successful people , Bill Gates must be one of the names we remember . He always have great ideas even when he see an idea of another person and transforms it in a better one with some modifications . Of course he 's surrounded by talented people but it 's another quality of the successful ones - they always choose the right people to the right place and then , with a smart staff you can achieve the success more easily .

If you want to be a successfull person , you need to improve some traits of your personality . First , you need to set a goal and be passionated about it . Related with that , you have to be persistent in your way through your goal . Second , you need to be resilient , beacuse there is a big possibility of failling . You need to be prepared to recover from a failure and set a new goal and start following it . The way to success is hard . In most cases you have to leave some other aspects of your life behind . You will have to evaluate if this compensates you .
Generally speaking ,. I believe that a trade agreement is something really important for a country economy , in which it is involved their tariffs and embargoes of imports and exports , mainly when it ends in a win - win situation . It 's great to a citizen stay current about them , regardless if it is not their country , because they might learn business tactics and to see what country took advantage from the agreement . I have learned from this lesson that NAFTA which stands for North American Free Trade Agreement , it is a trade agreement between the North American countries of Mexico , the United States and Canada in which was signed in <num> by the leaders of the three nations with the goal of a free trade among the three countries . Unlike the EU and Eurozone agreements , NAFTA did not adopt a single currency , and does not allow the free flow of people across the borders , as in any trade agreement , there are winners and losers like the US exports more services to its neighboring countries than it imports .
I think most people would agree that successful people are passionate , persistent and probably pretty competitive . The thing that strikes me , however , is that you can have these traits , but that does not necessarily mean you will be successful . I think you also need to have a great idea or some kind of vision that nobody else has . When. I think of successful people ,. I think of Steve Jobs . People say he could lose his temper and did not always listen to others , but he had fantastic ideas . That 's what mattered more than anything else . I guess it 's true that he surrounded himself with incredibly talented people , but who would not want to work with him ? He could pick and choose who he wanted to work with because he had the ideas . He also understood what people wanted , maybe before people even knew what they wanted themselves . That was his genius . He could imagine the world in a way that no one else could and make it become a reality . His passion , his creativity and his inner drive made him one of the most successful and innovative people of our generation .

Dear John , We have selected an ad campaign for Century watches . I am sure you will love our choice of campaigns . Many people think that Century is a classic and well - known because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns . While this might be true , it is also true that customers prefer Century because it 's simply the best and most reliable watch maker on the market . That 's the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top three watchmakers worldwide . Considering Century 's trend of working with famous stars , we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign . We decided , however , that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement . For this reason , we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf , simple and crystal clear but with a slogan that delivers and efficient message . A message not directed to stars and athletes , but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad . " Golf and Century . The perfect team " is a simple message that everyone can understand.

Dear Jonh Smith , The new trend in this modern world is the sustainability , we can use it to sell our cards by printing on them the photos of endangered and extinct animals . We can divide the cards into some categories like extinct , endangered and vulnerable animal , we can create also a special kind of cards with the photos of cute wild animals like coalas and pandas , the kids will love it ! ! Nowadays everyone is interested in environment , the cards will be a good seller . We wo not have problems with copyrights for the photos , because we already have some copyrights , when we used them in our last pack . We will have to pay for some copyrights , but the cost will be less than we supposed it would  be . I may be the editor , that 's will be my first time , but. I have got lots of experience by working in our last pack ( African set and animals from Americas ) . I am awating for you opinion . Best Regards , Thanner Cardoso
I have always been a firm believer that God gave the sun to the human beings to produce vital energy : electricity , heat , and light . Since ever , we have been using only the light . In my opinion our city should promote the installation of solar panels to produce energy and heat . As a matter of the fact , the cost of such a system is still to high but , if the number of installations increases , its cost will shortly decrease . An incentive to those who will install solar panels should be granted by the Municipality as well . I am sure that using this renewable energy in few years we will manage to reduce the air pollution in our region . It will be due to the dicreasing of the CO2 emission caused by a less use of the conventional energies . We should even launch a " solar energy campaign " aimed to promote the use of the solar energy on the roof tops , i.e. residential homes , workshops and warehouses . Solar panels will produce electricity and hot water on a daily basis replacing , sooner or later , the coal power plants currently working for this purpose . Our schools should also take part in this exciting and healthy initiative by promoting ad hoc discussion in classrooms amongst the students . Thank you for your kind attention . Any questions ?
I think green business are a proof that people is getting worried about the environment , and that they are putting a side economic benefits in order to create green products or operate in the most eco friendly manner . I think maybe their prices are higher than not green companies but nowadays is harder to work being green so the prices are logically high . Even though. I support green business. I wonot get out my way to find their products , the reason is that. I live in a small town and green products arenot very popular. I could found some products in the supermarket saying that there are green but they are made for big companies that make a lot more products that arenot green , so. I donot take their word for it . I would like to found more green products here , and. Iwill definitely like to buy organic food . I think organic food is a great way to start to be green and also provides great benefits for health and farmers markets are easily to find in every city .
Dear Paula , Thank you for your e - mail and the chance you are giving me to help you . I will try to do my best and suggest few tips for solving your problem with the food expenses . So , let me start with revising the way you have your meals during the day . In the morning , it would be better if you make coffee yourself and drink it at home , instead of buying expensive latte on your way to work . Also , except coffee , you can try to prepare a cheese and vegetables sandwich before you leave for work , so you will have a homemade lunch , which will be cheaper and healthier than anything bought near you office . As for the evenings , nothing could be funnier than a pleasant dinner with friends at your place , where everybody could bring delicious things and share the cost of food . I know it sounds like a lot of time in the kitchen cooking but trust me , it will worth the effort . You will have the money saved and the fun experienced . Good luck and bye . Diana
The New Contemporary museum Welcome to the New Contemporary Museum where you can enjoy yourself in a spectacular exhibit passing through three artistic movements . In the. Impressionist wing you will admire the breath - taking " The Road Bridge of the Argenteull " , by C. Monet ( <num> ) . This canvas was painted on - site , next to the river of the Seine , and it also represents a Parisienne view surrounded by floating boats enlightened by the usage of the lights on the different objects . This exhibit will start on September the 5th and it will run to January the 3rd . The next is the Expressionist wing where you may delight yourself with the famous " The Blue Rider " painted by Franz Marc , who really liked painting animals , especially horses which are perfectly represented in this painting . This exhibit will start on August the 1st until October the 1st . Our last exhibit is located in the Cubist wing brought to top by the presence of " Le Jour " by George Beaque ( <num> ) . the use of geometrical forms is well - painted in this masterpiece and this allows every viewers to have multiple viewpoints . It will start on the October 1st to March the 31th .
Talking about success ,. I believe , it is something that. I would like to describe by acting on it , and not just giving my opinion like anybody can do . Because honestly ,. I think to attain success , it is necessary to face a huge challenge , for instance in order to be successful , you need for example traits like : being passionate , persistent , competitive , professional , likable , honest and even most important , you need to have some kind of vision that nobody else has . However as. I said , it is a major challenge that unlikely , most of people can not achieve , and mostly about business . What it strikes me , is that some people are good listeners from their mentors and take advantage of that to grow up and reach the success easily and faster , and of course ,. I have met professional people with these qualities , like my Doctor and my special Teacher , as they show respect , patient and professionalism with clients .
Generally , Germany is a safe country . While crime does exist , it is rather low - scale . The most common forms of crime are petty theft , pick - pocketing , shoplifting , vandalism and street harassment . Violent crimes , such as assault , manslaughter or homicide , are rare but can occur in larger cities or high - risk areas . However , Germany has also seen a rise in organized crime like money laundering , drug and human trafficking as well as prostitution . A distinction is made between misdemeanours and felonies . The latter are punishable by prison sentences of one year or more , whereas misdemeanours get punished by either fines , a combination of a fine and a short incarceration under a year , or solely by some month of prison time . In some cases misdemeanours can also result in the loss of licenses . A Person which is between <num> and <num> years of age at the time of their offence , the maximum penalty is <num> year 's imprisonment . This is also the case for a person under the age of <num> who is not considered mature . Teenage criminals serve their time in detention centers . Although a prisoner can be sentenced to life imprisonment , in Germany this means the inmate is able to apply for parole after serving <num> years. Parole might be granted after good conduct and a low risk of recidivism .
There are many factors that make a person sucessfull . The success come together with a good ideia , with hard work , persistense and a important thing , believe in your self . If you trully believe in your self , in your life dream and make the things that you want to happen , really happens , the success will come for you . It 's not going to be an easy journey , you will fall down some times , but the important thing is that you have to get up , do some changes and keep going on . You have to take advantage and learn whit your mistakes . You can take important lessons on the things you have done by the wrong way and aplly this knowledge in your life . There will be a lot of competition on the way , all you have to do is be a honest and sincere person . So never give up on your dreams , be passionate and happy , in my opinion the most important thing in life .
I do not know so much about international trade but. I will try to invent something of this topic . I heard about MERCOSUR around twelve years ago ,. It 's acronym refers to trade between countries of South America . Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay , Uruguay , etc . They want to unit the trade and the border as EU , buy it did not work because the people do not like help each other , they just like help themselves . I am frustrated by centuries of deceptive , in other words. I do not believe in trade agreement between rich countries and poor countries . Apparently they are to created to help but it 's not had accomplished . Well , Look at it this way : The trade agreement is proposed by rich countries to sell their products . The rich countries have big companies to make manufactured products which are more expensive and the poor countries do not have sources to do it , the poor countries just have row products which are cheap , so the rich countries sell more and buy less , for otherwise the poor countries sell less and buy more . Then , Who is the winner ? .
Usually stories about thefts sounds like crimes or elaborate plans . Few years ago happened here in Brazil a funny story about a attempted theft . The robber tried stealing a beauty salon , there was nobody there , he took everything he wanted ( money , products ) . But. I think he was tired , because he slept there . The most incredible thing is that he actually fell asleep , after the owner of the salon arrived and saw the thief sleeping , the owner called the police that arrested the man . Surely this was the easiest job of these officers . This story reminds me of another story that happened ,. I saw this case in the TV . A man stole a car , then he was to stole a gas station , but while he was stealing this place , another man stole " his " car . The first thief went to the police to file a complaint , of course he was arrested . Here we have a saying " thief that stole a thief have a hundred year of forgiveness " ,. I do not agree with this , but. I think that the first thief received a nice surprise . Well , these are my unusual stories ,. I hope that you enjoyed .
Fortunately my life is not complicated . I do not have any physiological needs but sleeping problems , and it only happens when. I get some stress for some reason . I do need self - actualization on many things but. I am working on it , by going out more often to know more people , who have different habits and different knowledge because that way. I can get more self - confidence as well , if. I share my worries and they make me feel comfortable . I feel lucky because. I have a lot of love and affection specially from my friends , my partner , and my family . Although. I feel safe most of the time ,. I easily get worry about the safety of some member of my family every time they travel or go out just driving , because you never know what is going to happen if somebody else is not driving well for example . Besides that. I think. I only have to keep trying different things that make feel more confident with myself .
Last night the police got a call that there has been a murder crime in town . Arriving at the given address the police officers saw the open front door . Immediately they went in . It did not take a long time to find a man lying in his blood on the ground . Next to him stood a female person crying all over the time , sobbing and pleading . Stating it was just an accident she said , it was not on purpose . She only meant to stop him shouting . In fact , normally he is a gentle guy , but getting drunken always changed him into a shouting and disrespectful person . And she could not bear it any more . Some seconds later the neighbour got in accompanied by the police officer who waited outside the house . He confessed to be witness of that incident and that he would be willing to make a statement . So the police officers took both of them to the police station to ask them out and do further investigations .
A Renewable Energy Source for So Paulo The energy in my city is from no renewable sources in <num>  and the renewable sources correspond to <num>  . Most of the energy renewable source is from hydroelectric power station . I think that this is the most suitable renewable energy source ofr my city because we have some powerful rivers here in the state and the cost is relatively low : no costs of fuel are required and the construction and maintence compared to the amount of energy that can produce is very low . I like the idea of a solar power too . I think it could an option if you can afford it , individually . It could be used in the summer , when the sun is more constant , to spare some no renewable power . Due to the fact that my city is in subtropical area , we could not be able to use solar power the whole year . Another option for renewable source for So Paulo is sugarcane energy . We have a lot of sugar cane production and its alcohol is largely used as car fuel nowadays. Biomass energy is a good option in study by our government and the use of papers , building supplies , firewood , leaf , sawdust , could help us to make a good use of materials that would be considered trash .
The green business is the set of companies that , while maintaining the goal of profit maximization , manufactures and sells products and services while respecting the surrounding environment . A company 's green business tries to minimize the negative impact of its production and of the products sold on the exploitation of the environment . The environmentally friendly results in a reduction in the exploitation of non - renewable energy resources , production of a smaller volume of waste , minimization in the production of pollutants , placing on the market of biodegradable products . For my part. I have to honestly admit that. I am not very careful in the selection and use of products of the green economy . At least in the country. I live in ,. Italy ,. I am convinced that there is a lack in the culture and in structured informations about the benefits of environmentally friendly products . I also believe that companies seeking to produce environmentally friendly are not supported by the law and produce with costs that make their products less competitive to the benefit of large companies in the traditional trades .
Let me start saying several facts of Omsk , a city which is in Siberia , in Russia . This facts help us to determind the most appropriate kind of renewable energy , which might be installed in order to reduce nonrenewable ones such as coal , petroleum and natural gas . Omsk was built near the. Irtish , the biggest confluent of the Ob . Irtish is strong enough to build hydroelectric power station on it . Therefore , we can have a look at this source of energe . Regarding to solar power , unfornunately , we have no facitities to install it , because of lach of sun light during a year . So , we can not absorb solar energy from sun 's rays , despite huge free flat surfaces here . However , we can use wind power because of windy weather for most of the year . Comparing these two kinds of renewable energy available in this area , the hydro power will cost the city slighty less , nemaly  <num> for building , and require relatively low maintains costs . To sum up , Omsk is a city , where constant wind and large river can help with reducing the amount of fossil fuel consumed by the city . It would be possible if the council financed all expenses necessary for installation.
Last week. I was told by a friend an interesting story . He was driving <num> km / h over the speed limit and got busted by a speed camera . After he got the letter from the police department with the request to pay huge financial penalty and get away his licence for <num> months , instead of paying he called a lawyer . That lawyer , who already was familiar with this kind of trouble , delegated an investigation to state whether the camera was properly calibrated . The results were showing , that the camera operates within a speed volatility of + <num> km / h . So in the end the police had a photo of my friend driving a car way over the compulsory limit and a statement about an inaccurate camera . So although my friend was driving to fast , even within the worst case of the camera volatility ( <num> km / h so <num> km / h too fast ) , all charges had to be dropped , because of the terms of the german law . That was a funny story to tell and a fascinating experience , that states how much situations you can manoeuver yourself out of by accessing the narrows of the law . That s why. I think the law is imperfect and has to be adjusted for some issues. Thanks ! !

Speaking about two different testes of English , which would. I go for if. I wanted to know my level of English ? First of all ,. I need to know a purpose of them and the difference . Then. I can choose depending on my knowledge . Lets compare two very famous tests of English TO. IC and TOEFL . They both are considered to evaluate English proficiency , and needed to know if you can fit necessary requirements for institutes . The skills that are tested the same : listening , reading , speaking , writing all you need to understand and to make your ideas clearer for others . The main difference is - TO. IC tests English for the workplace , TOEFL for academic purposes and ; logically , TO. IC is used by employers and TOEFL by language programs and schools . SO the questions are supposed to be quite different , because TO. IC is used mainly by Training and HR managers and recruiters , and TOEFL for academic purposes , so you need to know a wild range of scientific words in English . There are more questions in TO. IC than TOEFL and almost the same test duration . So make it clear where do you want to go and what for - and good luck
In my opinion , a company has not only a responsibility to its shareholders , but also a responsibility to society . As a company , it should find effective ways to develop and try its best to make a big profit with the shareholds . However , it must take much more responsibiltiy to society . I believe we have a moral responsibiltiy not to harm the environment . We can make it office policy to recyle paper , use ceramic cups and save electricity . A company ought to pay its lowest employees a fair salary . A happy worker is a good worker , and it makes business sound sense to pay your employees well . Similarly , supporting your local community is good for both your community and your company . Companies should donate money to schools , plant trees , build new parks and sponsor local initiatives such as children 's sport . After all , local people are not just your nearest customers , they are also your workforce .
I want to greet all of you and. I hope you are enjoying the meal as am. I. Its a great pride for me being chosen to say a few words to toast to our beloved friend Marc . I am a very good friend of Marc , currently. I am living in Australia , working as a doctor , but my hometown its definitely Palma de Mallorca . I am very happy to come back to Spain with any reasonable cause , and this wedding it justify tremendously . I first meet Marc when we were at nursery school . We were around three years old . Since that moment , we have been always good friends , even when the distance was as big as now ; we always knew that we can count one another . I want to thank the bride and the groom for this fair tales wedding . Its really enchanted .. If you allow me ,. Ill tell you a short story about Marc : when we were approximately five years old , his family decided to go to the USA to Disneyland . He told them that he did nt want to go so far without me . Unfortunately for me , his parents make him changed his mind . As you can imagine , Marc its the most generous friend that. I have ever had , and without a doubt whatsoever , my best friend ever. Please rise the glasses to make a toast to wish Marc the happiness in his marriage that he deserves .
I would like to compare high school to university in Brazil . The classes. I took in high school were very easy compared to university courses . On high school , we do not have some freedom like at university . We have more flexibility on university . I learned grammar , literature , math , biology , chemistry , portuguese , history , physics and geography on high school . I learned business management and things that. I use in my job on university . Even though my university is very expensive ,. I think it 's a good investment . My parents do not think. I study enough . On the contrary ,. I study constantly . I did not work when. I studied at high school . But. I had to work for pay my course at university . Another difference was the way how the teachers talked with us . Whereas the teachers treated the students like childrens on the high school , in university we are treated like a adults . I guess that the two ages were unforgettable .
I really like an Brazilian hero , called Ayrton Senna . He knows exactly how to achieve success and being a successful person . Since of the <num> 's , he began to drive karts , small cars , pure driving . After some years on this category , he started to run on Formula One with the small team Toleman . He started to challenge great name as Alan Prost and others . He did not smoke or drinking , he just practiced a lot and he had natural skills to drive . He won the champioship tree times . He had never won on his country , Brazil . In <num> he made a miracle . He sad that ,. I talked to him ( god ) and he said , today , you are going to win . In the end of the race , he only had the 6th gear . The transmission of the car was broken . He could not change it . But he won . This is the greatest race of every time in my opinion .
CSR is divise issue . On the one hand , it can be good for the community as long as the Company 's actions are effective for the people . On the other hand , it can be seen as a simple PR trick or even unnecessary . I think both situations apply . First of all , because there are many companies that take advantage on the marketing of its social actions . Sometimes these actions are not really incisive as they could and should be . They are simply a way to advertise the company or some of its products . Maybe less expensive and more well seen than usual marketing . However , there are companies that really care about the society , as it is the most important part of the business . Without customers , no business can survive . Further , without good workforce , companies can not either exist . And all of them belong to society . So , in the end , CSR is a primal issue for a company , either because it helps to keep workforce and customers satisfied or because it 's a good way of doing marketing . But , of course , in order to consider a CSR action praiseworthy it has to be really effective , fare and good for the community.
You know what ? Yesterday ,. I saw my star . I did not believe it . He was near form me . I touched him . But. I did not able to put him a question , a good question . It was the emotional . I just said : " How are you ? " . I was like a kid before a gift . In reality , my star was more tall than the TV . He seems to be believe yourself . I felt that this person lived things a lot , even often , difficult things . He often works with numbers . In his past life , he had done surely mistakes , intentional or not ? The money was changing the people 's belief . it is not the only people who did mistake when we work much money . In more , He often falls in love , if. I can say it . He travels a lot ,. I do not always understand how. I met him . Here your name : " Dominique Strauss - Kahn " Are you fallen in love as me to you ?

The first site 's usability is greater than the second one . You can search specific genres and rare books and media . While the usability of the second one is really poor . You have to scroll down through all the screens to see what is sold . The product range of the first one is much more wider and various . Not even new but also used book at reasonable prices . The second one has items which look cheaply made . The options of delivery and payment of the first site are more diverse than the second site can offer . Also it has a free delivery at very low spend . The customer service is more helpful and friendlier . The customer service of the second site is not willing to help . On the first site there is a lot of useful functionality such as bestseller list with readers ' reviews and recommendations . The second one really lacks any .

As you can see , electing me will make the university a healthier place - for you and for the environment . So - vote for me , Anna Kane , future president of the student council ! We can change this place !
Dear Elisabeth , thank you for mail with a selection of images and slogans . I think ,. I would  prefer the " Golf and Century- The perfect team " . I choose it for the following reasons :. In the first place Golf is a traditional , classic but trendy sport . Secondly it is preferably played by successfull well established people mostly with a recognized social standard and high income- our target group ! To practise Golf you need to buy a certain- expensive- usually high quality equipement . The very picture going with the slogan is attractive because of it 's perspective and focus . It does not show any specific luxurious items . In contrast to the other two images , that seem to be too romantic and focussed only on a younger traget group , my preffered image evokes some phantasy just by some s allusions , it gives the spectator an impression of classic luxury and high quality .
The. Impressionist Wing The featured painting is the Bridge at Argenteuil by Claude Monet in <num> . He painted boats on the River Seine . As characteristics of impressionist , he used complementary colors and wanted to capture the effect of light and atmosphere and convey their sensory experience by using plenty technique . Exhibits from September 5th to January 3rd . The Expressionist Wing The famous painting is The Blue Rider by Franz Marc . He tried to capture the energy of animals . His compositions were radical and he experimented boldly with colors to express the primitive energy of animals . It is a part of the permanent collection , but closes on October 1st for refurbishment . The Cubist Wing Featured painting is Le Jour by George Braque in <num> . It 's a still life done in muted greens , grays and browns . Objects are fragmented as if seen from multiple view points , but on the other hand , the composition is well - balanced . Cubism leads to the way for abstract art . Opening day is <num> October .
You will never believe this , but. I swear it 's a true story . I was reminded of that funny story of the pizza delivery man just when we got stuck in the elevator . It 's an incredible story . The delivery man was send to an appartment building to , which surprise , deliver a pizza . Not really alarming , though he never came back . His employer was concerned and called the police . They immediately started to search for the delivery man but they could not find him . Eventually they accused a butcher because they found blood on his clothes ! What a surprise you might think , a butcher with bloody clothes . Yes ,. I guess the police must have been really desperate . But the most incredible thing happend when they were about to arrest the butcher . The police was just putting the butcher in handcaffs when they heard a hushed scream . The delivery boy was caught in the broken elevator and they finally rescued him . They both really lucked out !
I got stuck in an elavator yestarday , and it reminded me of a story about pizza delivery guy who got stuck in a elevator for days . Have you heard that one ? So , this guy is sent to delivered pizzas to several apartment building , but he never comes back to work . His employer call the people the guy was supposed to delivered to . They all say that they received their orders . Next , he calls the police to see if there have been any bicycle accidents : nothing . Feeling more and more desperate , the employer visits all the buildings the guy delivered to . He still finds nothing . After <num> hours , the police declare the guy a missing person and start to investigate .

Communication in my country is generally indirect . By that. I mean people do not like to make very direct statements for fear of offending or upsetting others . This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings . You have to become skilled at reading between the lines to understand what someone is really trying to say . Along with this indirect style of communication , goes a rather formal use of body language . People in my country do not make a lot of gestures while speaking . One gesture we do often use is the thumbs - up ; that means ' great ' or ' OK , ' which. I think is the same everywhere . In some countries , it 's common to put a hand on another 's shoulder , or even hug , but that kind of behavior makes people feel uncomfortable in my country . You need to have known someone a long time before there 's any physical contact . The best advice. I could give to someone visiting my country is , when first meeting someone , to hold back a bit . Watch what other people do , and listen a lot . Rather than ask a lot of questions , wait to be asked questions . And , like. I said , try not to be too physical in your interactions
First of all ,. I would  like to thank you all for coming tonight . We are here together to celebrate the marital union of Amine ( my brother ) and Emily . It 's a pleasure for me to offer a toast to this beautiful couple . Let me tell you a cute story about the first date between my brother and Emily . They were first - year college and amine fell in love with this charming creature at first glance . He has not ceased to follow her every time they left the amphitheater , and that for weeks . One day , he took his courage in both hands and decide to declare his love to Emily . He was very nervous and so shy , that made us ( me and my friends ) laugh ! Yes. I forgot to mention that we followed him in secret during this moment . Now look at them , three years later they married each other , is not beautiful ? So , Amine , Emily. I raise my glass as all of us tonight for you and we toast to the health , prosperity and hapiness of your couple . To Amine and Emily !
Sandy was my boss when. I worked for Cigna life insurance company . She is a person with traits that. I admire of . 1 . ) She is persistent and resilient . 2 . ) She never gives up and leaves room for everyone working for her . 3 . ) She is soft when she encounters tough fight back . Corporate politics is sometimes ruthless . Soft means no immediate cross - fire but wait and see . 4 . ) She is agile and fast respond to challenge . Urgent matters are always treated well and steadily . 5 . ) She is smart and quickly locate the issue . If staff present something in the meeting , she can always pinpoint issues and bring up her insights . 6 . ) She is decisive , so people do not need to guess or conceal anything in front of her . Once she makes the decision , staffs work for the target and report the status to her . I think to be a good leader is not easy . She must have been well trained in the past , and have talent on leadership . I wish one day. I can have my own good bits of traits to be admired by my staffs .

I think in my town it would be the best to use solar power . Nuremberg is said to be the second sunniest city in Germany and since there are no wide open areas or strong rivers that could make wind farms or hydropower possible , it seems most plausible to install solar panels on roof tops or house walls throughout the city to generate renewable energy . While it is necessary to reduce our impact on the environment by living sustainably and without creating too much waste , it also seems appealing that you become independent by using an infinite and free source like the sun . The installation of solar panels would cost the city  <num> . Of course , this is quite an investment and the costs of maintenance have to be taken in consideration as well . But , considering the increasing costs of energy from fossil fuels and the price we pay by destroying our environment , it is a small amount of money . In my opinion , solar power would be the most sustainable and profitable way to generate energy for my city .
The. Impressionism began in Paris as a reaction to very formal and traditional styles of painting . Impressionist painters prefer to pain outside and they studied the effect of natural light on objects . The first painting to highlight is " The Road Bridge at Argenteuil " by Claude Monet . It was created in <num> . The painting was done at bridge . It show the River Seine . The painter used complementory colours blue - orange and green - red . It was one of the peculiarity of. Impressionsm . This exhibit will begin at Sep 5th to Jan 3rd . The Expressionist Collection will be exhibit on October 1st . It was organized by two groups of German painters : The Bridge and The Blue Riders . Blue Rider artists included Franz Marc , Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky . The painting " The Blue Rider " was created by Franz Marc . Franz Marc liked painting horses . He experimented with bold colors . He liked to paint animals . The Cubist Wing will be exhibited 1st October to March <num> . The Cubism was inspired by Picasso and Braque in Paris . Pablo Picasso liked to use geometrical forms . He showed multiple viewpoints of one figure . He is a forerunner of abstract art .
For a start. I would  like to thank you all for coming here today , because your concern is my concern . The foundation of a developed society begins at school . And it is my goal to assure that students will have their voice heard if you vote for me . Being the president of the Students Council requires much more than good intentions , it requires leadership skills , focus , and determination . I can tell you that. I have these traits . I have volunteered at the city rest home and. I have been engaged in the animal protection cause , because. I believe it 's our duty to watch over the needed , and provide them with what we would like to be provided if we were in their shoes . As a president od the Student Council. I will demand a new library as well a new and more modern computers for our. IT lab . Our kinderngarten playground should also be renovated with new toys . We can raise funds with local companies , comunity donations and raffles . I count on you to bring our school to a new era of development!
Our statistics show that we can broaden our customer base in both demographic groups . First of all , only <num>  of <num> to 19-year old women purchase at least one magazine a month ; we can work to bring it to <num>  . Similarly , we can bring the percentage of 18- to 24-year - old men who purchase at least one magazine a month from <num>  to <num>  . In both groups , we need a better strategy to improve website - based products . In addition , we should increase our sales in the 15- to 19-year - old demographic since <num> competitive products already exist . However , demographic group <num> also calls for attention because there is <num> long term and <num> recent competitive products . Furthermore , in both groups , purchasing power is estimated to increase by <num> . However , it would be more profitable to expand into the market of demographic group <num> that shows a greater estimated increase , from  <num> to  <num> billion . On one hand , investments should preferably focus on one group , but on the other hand , sharing the risks between both of them might be a win - win solution .
For sure , there are different opinions about having superstores in the city . Some people argue for it , and have their own reasons to believe that it 's good for the community and the economy , but , in the other hand , a lot of people see it as a threat and , at the same , this group of people have their own reasons to believe that . For those , who defend that it 's good , the most common sense is that having big - box stores in the city could create a lot of new jobs to the society . Besides that , although it 's a new competitor for others stores , it brings lower costs for everyone . For this group of defenders , even the other stores can survive , because they have a big profit that can be compressed for the consumers benefit . On the other hand , the group that argue against this kind of stores believe that it can close others small stores . They think that these small stores doesnot have condition to compete in cost with the superstores . So , under these circumstances , it could decrease the number of employes in the city . In my opinion , the consumers have the power of decision . The government must allow the store to be opened.. If the consumer does not buy the store is going to close anyway . Free market is the best choice for all .
In Brazil , big - box stores generate many jobs which are much better for the employees compared to small business . Labor laws in Brazil are better for the employees in big companies than in small ones because the government have politics to help small business to grow , so they do nt offer a lot of benefits neither better salaries like big companies do . Another good point about big - box stores is that they offer cheaper products due to economy of scale . The cons of this kind of business is that they play an unfair competition game providing a real threat for the small business , as well as hiring better employees .
At first. I think it 's really important to define what it means to be successful . A person can be successful in many areas of life . Bill Gates for example made a lot of money in the unfoughten leader in this branch so you can call him a successful businessman . The Jamaican Usain Bolt has been the fastest sprinter of <num> m in the last years and so he is also very successful . Another example is Nelson Mandela , a succesful politican , who brought peace to south africa and to other countries in the world . To say who of them is successfulier than the other is quiet impossible . But it 's easy to say what they all have in common , passionate about what they are doing . But it 's not enough just to be apssionate you also need are specific traits and habits , which make you special and help you to succeed . Bill Gates had the innovative idea to develop a universal operating system for PC 's . But this isnot the only reason for his success , he is also really driven in improving the system and in developing new softwares . Furthermore he has a big knowledge about how to find the right people for the right tasks and how to deal with them to make money.

Dear Elizabeth , Many people think that Century is a classic and well - known brand , because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns . While this might be true , it 's also true customers prefer Century because it 's simply the best and most reliable watchmaker on the market . That 's the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top watchmakers worldwide . Considering Century 's trend of working with famous stars , we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign . We decided , however , that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement . For this reason , we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf , simple and crystal - clear , but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message ; a message not directed to stars and athletes , but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad . " Golf and Century . The perfect team . " It 's a simple message that everyone can understand . I look forward to hearing from you regarding our decision . Best regards

Green business is not an easy concept as well as to work on . I believe that there are not many companies in the world which can do business greenly from beginning to the end including energy , production chain or waste water . So , it is easy to have a business of friendly environment by some ways such as using organic , or recycles materials . I do not go out of my way to buy green products . It is obvious that it is more expensive . On the other hand ,. I do not think any company in my country develops substantially and then people find it difficult to have real green products in the city . However ,. I also try to plant or do green products if. I can and. I think. I do not have many choices for it .
Hi Nick , You wrote me how stressful your life has became recently and. I am worried about you . Above all you are my friend , so here 's a couple of advices to you that may help dealing with stress . - Be more effective as a time manager . It 's wise to set up a list of important things to do in your job and prioritise them - Focus on what helped you to beat stress . It may be discussing stress situations with your relatives or friends like me - Keep sound mind in a sound body . Observe your daily regime and promise not to combat stress with alcohol . Boozing may become the only thing that makes your stress go away . - Try to be positive . It concerns not only positive thinking , but also learning to say ' no ' when needed . - Be assertive but polite in communications . Just think about my advices . Best wishes , Vlad
There are definitely both pros and cons associated with superstores , but. I think we have to be realistic about the circumstances of some communities . I understand the argument that superstore create primarily low - wage jobs and provide few if any social or health benefits to those same workers . I also understand that these giant stores could possibly bankrupt smaller stores that are unable to compete with them . I think just about everyone knows this to be true . On the other hand , if a community is already in economic trouble , with few jobs available and people strugging , saying ' no ' to a superstore does not seem to make any sense at all . Is not a low - wage job better than no job at all ? if a community is strugging , would not the lower price that a superstore can offer help those most in need ? I want to reiterate that. I understand that superstores are not the answer for every community . Different communities have different circumstances and different needs . All. I am saying is that , under certain circumsgtances , a superstore might do more good than harm for a strugging community .

One of its other main concerns is improving the living standards and education of people in Asia - Pacific countries .
When. I first joined the website singwithfreedom.com the first thing that was slighly accentd in the foreground was an introduction - video , which showed a little excursion " into " the site . During the video all surfing options to navigate were presented and additional advice were given to get the most out of the site . After watching the video , everything was quite plain to me-. I guess , that could have been the main intention of the operator ( - ; Adding to that , the construction itself is somewhat intuitive ; there 's an horizontal navigation - bar after joining into the members area . The site memorizes the access datas (. I really like that , despite all security - problems which could arise ) and you can easily jump from there to a specific site of interest . However , you can choose to browse to the main page and check out the news , which are clearly outlined in another , vertical bar . From there you can choose to browse to another content by clicking on linked pictures which depict the content clearly and precisely . All in all it was the introduction video which essentially left not question unanswered ; thumbs up for this good idea !
Good evening everyone . We are all gathered here today to celebrate the wedding of Mary and James . As you might know ,. I am George , the groomsan . I have known James since we were at the high school . I am really honored to be here at his wedding and to have been his best friend for such a long time . I would  like to offer a toast to him and to his beautiful wife . First of all ,. I would like to tell how Mary and James met . One day , when we were walking home after school , a terrible downpour started . Never did. I see so much rain ! However , as we were going to our friend 's house to get some cover , we met Mary , completely wet from head to toe . James , that has always been quicker than us with girls , invited her to follow us : " You might get a cold , if you stay there under the rain " , he said . So she followed us . After two weeks they start dating . Their story was a bit stormy : never did. I meet such a difficult girl ! It was their love for each other that kept them together above all . I hope that one day. I will be able to find myself what they found.. I wish your love would never end . Now raise your glasses and toast to the happiness of them . To Mary and James !
Dear James My team and. I have chosen the image and slogan for the new advertising campaign . I have no doubts that you will enjoy it . As everybody has knowledge Century is well know for the glamour and style . All these years of advertising we always have used the same slogan talking about glamour and golf . For the reason that we must do something different this time we believe the best image is the first one where there is a woman with a flower . This picture shows how women have increased in our market not like people who receive presents like Centuries watches but like people that decide buy our products by herself . Just for the reason they are reliable and have very good quality not only because their glamour . The slogan is also very strong and can show all our glamour and stylish without use these words . That 's the reason we think it is the best option . That 's why we consider the public must like the new image because it keep the traditional elegance with a new look.
The Brazilian architecture is very interresting ,. In So Paulo we have a lot skyscrappers , off course they are not as tall as the Empire State Building , or as impressive but they are beautiful in their own way . Rio de Janeiro has the biggest soccer stadium in Brasil , The Maracan . Is huge and now they are rebuilding it for the World Cup <num> . so. I believe that when it 's finished it will be more impressive than it was before . But in my opinion the most beautiful architecture is in Brasilia , The capital of Brasil , first the whole city was designed in the shape of an airplane , with the wings and all , and there is some magnificent places designed for the best architect ever Oscar Niemeyer . The Cathedral of Brasilia is stunning , is one of my favorites .
The Green Scene A report on the status of green business and green reputation Executive summary. It 's a challenge to define ' green business . ' ' Green ' has become a way to run a business as well as a way to manufacture a product . Making a conscious choice Green businesses do their part to conserve natural resources as much as possible . Some environmentally conscious businesses install green roofs , vibrant break area for employees . Green businesses use organic , recycled , reusable or biodegradable materials as part of their business processes or to manufacture products , including food , paper products or packaging . Some companies are greener than others People are increasingly attracted to the concept of sustainability . As a result , many go out of their way to support green business and buy green products . In doing so , they sacrifice ethics for profit . In fact , some people have become so disgusted by ' greenwashing ' efforts that they are put off by the entire green industry . To be aware of ' greenwashing , ' people can continue to question whether a business is truly green . Certification programs are available that require companies to follow regulations that are truly green and encourage a revolution of innovation in the green world .
Dear Paula , In order to start saving money and start economizing. I would recommend you as follows : instead of drinking double latte coffee every morning why do not you prepare your coffee at home before leaving to go to work ? You might start enjoying your breakfast like it never happened before . I would also recommend you to prepare some healthy food the evening before so that you can take it with you the day after and eat it at the park together with some colleagues . It might be a different way to spend your lunchtime and relax a bit . I am sure that avoiding non - healthy food will bring benefits also to your diet . After work , why do not you try to organize a nice dinner at home , instead ? In this way you will spend more time with your friends while preparing good food and have a talk with them . Simple things are the best in life . I hope you will follow my advice . You will be happier and with more money in your pocket ! Best regards , P.P.
You can not deny that there are pros and cons about superstores . But you have to be realistic about economics , even if it hurts sometimes . Superstores are highly efficient and they provide many benefits . Customers can buy almost all they need at once . If a community has few jobs available and people struggling , a superstore can be the solution - it will create jobs and will pay taxes , thus supporting the thriving of the community . But there are some issues , indeed . Superstores create primarily low - wage jobs and they provide few social or health benefits to their employees . Furthermore , these giant stores could possibly drive smaller ones into bankruptcy . I would  like to reiterate that superstores are not the solution for every community . It all depends on the economic and social structure . But no one can deny that , under certain circumstances , a superstore might do more good than harm for a struggling community .

It 's very difficult to write about the corporate social responsability . First , we have to understand what is a good political of corporate social responsability . I mean : is that a good political give a lot of money to a school or a community and donot have any responsabily on where the money will be used ? Or the company must to create a program that indicate where and how the people have to do to give the money ? So , it 's a very good question . I think that the company must have your own political of corporate social responsability inside and outside . Inside they would recicle papper , using glass cup and economizing electric energy and for the community they must to do a program to evoluate in general the people around . A best place to live , a good school and some fun .. I think it ' s the best way to do a real corporate social responsibility .

Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen , My name is Marcelo and. I am here to convince you that. I am the best candidate for student council president . As you know ,. I have been working in the students committee for the last <num> years . During this period , we achieved great success in implementing several new programs such as " free weekends for all " , " funny sports " and " top chef 's restaurant " .

I can count on you to elect me . I am a natural leader with passion to help . I truly believe that. I can make a difference if you elect me . As student council president , you will have someone to work for your rights . And. I will not desappoint you . So , thank you for your attention ! Marcelo .
I do not know exactly how old the concept of corporate social responsibility exactly is . Indeed , it became obvious that a concept like that is needed after the big scandals around Enron and other big corporations who squandered the retirement savings of thousands of their employees because of mismanagement . Since then rules around the report management of a corporation have been exacerbated . The argument and therefore the mistrust towards CSR that it might only be a marketing device was entitled when CSR started its breakthrough . I rely on a totally new generation that is entering now the workplaces , the " generation y " , who are much more demanding towards sustainability and social responsibility . I think they do not consider it only as a management concept , as one among thousand others , but they believe in these values . If their employer behaves in a careless way towards the environment or the society , they will not forgive those mistakes . No , they will leave the employer , and , what is more , they will stop buying their products . And that will really hurt the companies .
Dear Mr. Nantakarm ,. I am writing to update you on our progress . I am sure you will be glad to know that we have tested the samples and determined that the quality is excellent . Although we identified an issue with some of the packaging materials , we immediately fixed it . Marketing then sent the samples to seven key partners for further testing . Once we receive the feedback , we will develop several marketing campaigns for your review . We plan to mail the materials to you on July 15th ; alternatively , you could visit our headquarters after July <num> to discuss them . In either case , it 's critical that we receive your comments by July <num> . I can arrange a meeting for you and Mr. Salas to touch base the week of August 8th . Could you let me know whether that works for you ? Please contact me with any concerns . Best regards , Lauren Reese
The whole question of C S R is a difficult one . there are powerful arguments on both sides of the issue . ON the one hand , it can be argued that corporations owe nothing to society other than running the business , paying taxes and following the laws of the country . The job of taking care of society is for the government . People do not ask politicians to make products , so why should we ask to solve society 's problems ? On the other hand , companies have a big impact on society . if the companies factory pollutes the environment they should clean it up . Companies also can help the communities where they operate . After all the community is letting them do business there . it is a two way street . I think a companey has to follow the law and to be responsible if it does anything wrong that affected people or community . Corporations can be a force for good in the world .
Dear Mayor Bleak ,. I am writing to you to express my opinion about opening our community to the Big - box store . I firmly believe that there are other options in order to bring jobs and more opportunities to our citizens , have you think about the very attractive small village flavour we have in our town ? There is an opportunity to exploit that " flavour " through its promotion looking for more and more tourism , that would create necessities to be satisfied for people visiting our town , things like restaurants , hotels , entertainment , tourist guides etc that would bring investors and well paid jobs , and not just minimum wages , part time jobs , and all that negative impact that would come as a negative consequence of the Big - box store . I want to reiterate my interest in the best option for our town and this is just my idea , but. I want to point out that there are multiple options that could be explored in a neighborhood meeting where people could contribute with their ideas on how avoid the loose of our community sense and its loved habits .

I want recommend this music as an example of positve emotions and faith in the good future when life itself is not very good now .

In Brazil , the situation of TV is not much different than some other countries . Many channels and programs shows girls and boys in sexual situations , in a very innapropriate hour , when childs are wathcing . In my opinion , this fact can be very dangerous for the mental development of them in the future . The same thing happens whit the violence presented in some series and movies . People who watches this type of content can become insesible and agressive in their relationship whit others . But this problem can be solved : rigid parental control and sense of morality by the watchers are efficient tools !

Initially ,. I want to say that. I am not a fancier of TV programs , but. I am crazy watching of transmission soccer alive . In my opinion , the programs on TV in my country are very bored , moreover , there are too much violence and sex . There are too many commercials , but in spite of this , we can find many jingles very interesting . I feel strongly that the rating is very complex , mainly about of the programming the cable television . The kids have access all the programs without any control or supervising of yours parents . I think that should be a regulator organ to adapt the programming at age of the spectators .. I think should be restrictioons , but never CENSURE ...

The TV in my country , Brazil , is manipulative , the biggest TV network , called Globo , imposes the politics , football , behaviors , education and others . The Globo is a large network of corrupt , as the politicians of my country . The open TV show many bullshit , could pass something more educational than novel and newscasts with news filtered , only those relevant to the issuer . The Brazilian TV has a lot to improve , but the power struggle of competing broadcasters and manipulation of citizens ,. I find it hard to happen any significant breakthrough .
New techologies are growing in. Italian schools . For primary schools it 's common for students use tablet in classes and study with e - book . But these new technologies are not usual for secondary schools , colleges and Universities . However it 's possible for all people to get degree at online colleges . I am all for new technologies in education , but. I would  like kids learn also to read normal book . Today in. Italy the online schools are considered more easy than the normal ones . So. I am all for standard schools , but using the new technology for studying .

In my country , we have strict laws about work safety . In my opinion this is a good thing . Because there are still plenty of accidents at work , because the workers often do not respect to the regulations .

I think it 's a good thing .

The winner throw one on all squares until reach the " sky " .

I feel strongly that we have few open TV shows , with high quality in Brasil . The most of sitcoms are silly , and not instrctives . I think that we have some educationals programs in open TV , like news and documentaries , bur the most of them are nocives for children . The operas soaps just show sex and violence , and the reality shows just explore the same . In my opinion . the best show for children are the sports and the cartoons , made specially for them .
I believe that in the future , the people will work less than nowadays because everything will be more simple to be executed . No matter what the things will be going ,. I think the technology will develop the knowledge and aid the humankind to reach a right stuff of comfort . I am very optimist concerning the wellness that the technology is going to improve us . The only thing that. I am pessimist , is the relationship that the humankind has being adopt to treat each other facing the religion and cultural differences .
I am very optimistic about the new technology in the future . Soon , robots help the doctors at heal the people . I think that robots also help us in the life of everday . The robots , we will not replace in our work , because we have need doing some activity for our health . I believe , we do not ready for do trust at the robot now . Perhaps in <num> years , we doing trust at the robot . Teleconference is good for the buiness company . People do not need of travel for doing several conference . In the future if we add the 3D this will be wonderful . I believe in the new technology .

Definitely ,. I was not awake enough t so. I made a terrible mistake . Overall it was the most funny situation. I have had in many time .
The first time that. I met my girlfriend was in a bar . I went out with a friend of mine to a small bar in my city . In there , he saw a girl that he was dating . She was on a table with other ten girls . We took a place on the table , but. I was really ashamed because. I did not know any of the girls . Some time later , a band begun to sing a song and everyone got up and started to dance . I was a little drunk and. I did not knew how to dance . My future girlfriend came to me and tried to teach me some dance steps , but. I stepped on her foot several times . It was two years ago .

I just listened to the song'Home. Improvement ' by Josh Woodward . It 's a folk - rock tune , and. I think it 's pretty catchy . I listened to it six times , and can not get it out my head . Josh 's voice is rough and edgy - He does not have much of a range . but he hits a few high notes . I was also a little confused , The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick , adictive beat .But. I think that the lyrics and political , sad and sentimental - Very intresting ! I recomend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song .
The education is changing in France . Indeed , the government actuelly test the deutch 's model . You work and learn in the morning , in the afternoon , you make sport , and in the evening you have your homeworks . I am agree with this schedulde . You can pratice sport or art every day and it 's easiest to work on night after that . In france , there are a lot of test , and two examens . The first one is at the end of the middle school , the second one at the end of the high school . I am all in test . It could be stressfull , but it is important for our children to be aware that hardworking is the key of the success .

I feel strongly that there are too many soap operas on TV in my country . For example , in the afternoon at least two soap operas in the main channels . On the night more three or four soap operas . In my opinion , the soap operas are very successfull because people like dramas and love . People forget their personal dramas and stress , watching the characters fiction lives . Basically ,. I can not stand soap operas . I think people can spend their time reading , watching good films or making another things .

In fact ,. I m neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future ,. I m rather very curious and a little excited , as everything could happen : the best as well as the worst . As for the best , we could imagine the end of autocratic regimes and the spread of democracy all over the world , the end of poverty , of discriminations , the development of technologies and what that means in term of improving the quality of life . As for the worst , we could feared the utilization of the nuclear weapon , the exacerbation of fundamentalism and terrorism , the utilization of technologies to spy and enslave individuals and , why not , we could imagine the seizure of the power by the robots , like in science fiction , frightening , brrrrrrrrrrrr ! ! ! So , wait and see , and for the present , carpe diem !
When. I was <num> years old , we had the biggest flood in <num> years . It was called the Flood of <num> . It was crazy . There was no traffic on the roads , and everything was closed . It was impossible to move ! I was happy because. I did not have school for a whole week . But for other people , it was more difficult - for example , people who need to get to the hospital to have a baby or get other help . Those people were assisted by the police . It was amazing ! the police take more time to reach people and help them in time .

Hi Renee ,. I compared the survey with my own viewing habits . The results of the survey say that most people in my age group like to watch news & weather . I agree with that . I watch it every day .

White collar people usually watch the news in the evening and that matches with my habits , too . Kind regards Gerald

I recently made a reservation at an vegan and organic restaurant called Happy Food , every vegetable was produced in their own field and without agrochemical . Surprisingly ,. I ate the most delicious sundwish that i have never eat . It had lettuce , tomatoes and artichoke with olive oil and a delicious soya hamburguer . And it was accomppanied with mustard sauce . The sandwish was better than Mc Donald 's . In the most of time we usually eat what the market offers to us , but we have an unhealthy culture of food . So , we must try other ways to eat . The organic and vegan food can extent our lifes and make we feel betther with our body .

I am not very optimistic about our future , because we will have to contend with a huge mass of problems , as the growing pollution , the increasing of the world population with the relative need of producing more foods and more houses , and the ends of the petrol reserve .

In the US , the trend is to give tests to students more often . I am all for tests if they are written well . I am against them when they have too much importance . For example , it 's common for a student to fail the grade if they fail a big test . Another trend is for older people to take college courses . It 's not unusual to see a 60-year - old going back to school . I totally support that idea . It 's funny , because many 18-year - olds are not even in college . Some of them work for a few years until they figure out what they want to do , and some do not go to college at all .
I am very optimistic about the future . with tecnology the methods of educations , transportations and communications will be easier and faster . I think oill will be gone after <num> years but scientists will innovate good things that can help us and keep our enviroments good . Lets imagin how the day will be in <num> . People will drive electric cars that can reduce pollution . Many people do not have to go out to works or study or shop all that can do it from thair houses . I am very excited about the future and. I hope that life will be more better from each sides .
Last month ago .. I and my husband consult our financial planner . he said when he will be <num> , he retire but , before this he will have set up college fund to our children to learn them well because in these days the education will be expensive . And when l am <num>. I will get my ph . d then get a good jop . we will build our investments to be comfortable in our retirement . Hopefully we will have saved alot of money to travel around the world , there are so places we never see them and we will buy a small house far away a noise and pollution .
I think the future will be incredible . Technology advancements can lead us to a world without hunger , disease , greed and war . I believe that clean energy will be used everywhere and that humankind will be able to explore others galaxies and planets . I also believe that in a future where every person can be healthy and happy , it 's sure that peace and love will prevail in all humanity . I am very optimistic about the future . It will be like paradise on earth .

Recently. I and my husband were at a new Marccelli 's restaurant that is situated near our house . It 's a restaurant of. Italian cuisine .

We ate tomatoes and basil with oil and vinegar dressing at start . Vegetables were not local , but they were organic and very fresh . As a main course. I took a soup from mushrooms and my husband ate his favourite spaghetti ? arbonara . It was very tasty , he liked it . For desert we ordered sundaes and cappuccinos . Everything was delicious !

In Brazil , the trend is to give tests to students more often , mainly in the last year of the high school . That is happening because in Brazil to pass to University you need to make a high level test . And only if you will have good grade , you will go to University . For example , it 's usual for a student to fail at first test when they choose courses like medicine , lawyer and engineering . Because many people want to do this courses and there are few vacancies .

I realized very quickly we were getting along with each other very well . So. I asked her out . Our first date was sushi and a movie .

In Peru , the trend is to give tests to students every time . It is also common that colleges require students to buy new books . I disagree with that because its a way to get more money from the students , when in fact the colleges should provide all the materials to students without no extra charge , that 's a way to demonstrate the concern of their students economy . Regarding the tests ,. I am all for tests if theyare written well . Furthermore ,. I am against for multiple choice tests , since that type of exams not demonstrate the real skills of the students . In my opinion tests are important to demonstrate the student 's knowledge .

The country where. I live there are many laws and in my point of view they are enough , but the main problem is getting them to be fulfilled , but. I will leave this conversation for another oportunity . Regarding traffic safety , we have a new law called zero tolerance , what this means , you can not drink alcohol and driving , alcohol and driving do not mix . If you are caught in this condition , depending on the amount of alcohol , you can lose your drive license or go to jail . I think this law very strictly , but. I am in favor of life and the figures show that accidents caused by it have decreased after the law went into effect . As my wife does not drink alcohol , when we go out or go to party , she usually driving her back . I have a friend who prefers to take taxi to avoid problems .

I recently attended a thesis defence talk at our research group . The student was very nervous , but she was sucessful in clarifying the new discoveries arising from her studies . She introduced the audience to her subject and clearly demonstrated the potentialities of nanostructured materials for drug delivery . In the end , the members of the jury were convinced of her merit and gave their approval for her PhD. Nevertheless ,. I think that few points could be substantially improved during the presentation . For instance , the quality of her charts was not very good and , some times , there was a lot of informations without a clear conexion among them . Personally ,. I would have appreciated more her work if she had established a clear relationship between her data and her conclusions . In addition , she did not highlighted the advantages of her system regarding similar ones found elsewhere . Summarizing , she did a nice job , but it should be improved for the future directions of her career .

When. I was growing up ,. I read newspaper printed on paper every sunday , it was really good because every person of the family gets the section that were more likely for them , and it helps the people divide the thinghs . Nowadays , is really more easier to keep informed , because you can read a newspaper everywhere you are with your laptop , tablet or smartphone , but the people are more individualist than when. I was a teenager . I really like that huge difference from that time to current time , even the people are more alone , but. I think the positive impact about the easilly information availabe to everybody everywhere is really helpfull . Also , nowdays you can research about an specific theme on the internet , you can study online , you can learn languages from a distance . .. The information is available for everybody . Nowadays no one can claim about the miss of knowledge improvement .
Dear Janice ,. I am writing to say how terribly sorry. I am for what Selma said this morning . It was very rude and insensitive of her to go on about money . She certainly did not mean to upset or embarrass you . Although. I am not looking to give excuses ,. I did want to explain her reasons for putting her foot in it . It 's just in her country they talk about money all the time and it did not occur to her that she might be overstepping the mark . She 's just learning about how to behave in America and believe me , the last thing that. I wanted to do was cause a scene . I hope that you can forgive me and that. I can continue to stay in your beautiful house . Once again , please do accept my sincere apologies . With best wishes , ...
Good morning everyone ! The purpose of this meeting is to discuss about some problems that we are having with the costumer service , many clients complain about the attendants , the costumers says in most of the complains that they are rude and do not Know our products . I would  like to suggest fire them and hire new attendants , because they are much young and do not know how to answer the costumers demands properly . Or we can train the attendants teaching them how to answer the calls , and showing the range of our products and services . The clients also complain about our refunds policy they do not agree with a lot of terms and conditions , in true this is a difficult point , because we need sales to get profits if we refund all the purchases we wo not be able to pay the bills , so. I suggest that we change the products if the clients complain .

I must say :. I am not a thrill - seeker . I definitely do not like extreme sports like hang - gliding , skydiving , climbing , snowboarding and others of the same type . I believe that my body has been prepared for other type of activities . For instance , hang gliding can put you in a really bad situation . What about if the wind changes in the middle of the trip , and you can not dominate the equipment ? Speaking on white - water rafting , what could happen if you collide with a rock , in deep water ? I think it 's absolutely insane . I am not a coward , by contrast ,. I consider myself intelligent . But doing extreme sports is not a pass to get a big. I.Q ! !

The COO proposed another meeting to discuss if the companies would have money in the budget to promove the merger , which would be very expensive due to the differences between the two companies .

When. I was growing up , our reading was limited to the printed page . Digital publishing changed all that . People read on tablets , e - readers , laptops , desktop computers , phones and even wearable computers . Instead of carrying around a heavy backpack of textbooks , students can do all of their schoolwork on a tablet . What if you do not understand something in your digital textbook ? Just tap on a link on your gadget ; a pop - up window immediately provides you with helpful information . Even better , a video might pop up to provide an explanation . As a bonus , electronic communications media allows you to change the font size to make things easier to read . Now , you are able to create your own original publications : poetry on a website , an essay for a blog or even an e - book for an online publisher or bookstore . As a result , there are millions of fascinating texts to read that were never available before . A favorite of mine is a blog called ' Travels and. Images ' where the authors write and put photos about beautiful places that they travelling . We can travel with them through the computdor screen .

Are the roles of males and females the same nowadays ? Even if there have been a lot of evolution since the early <num> 's ,. I think that there is still inequality between women and men in France . Regarding workplace , do you really think men and women are equal ? Well you wish . Men still in majority have better job with more responsibility and earn more money than women . However , this tend to change with time . We observe more and more big companies ' CEO as women . Yet in <num> 's , women did not go to school or did not have a degree as high as men because they used to have children earlier .. In <num> , women are more focused in their career so they spend more time at school and have kids later . At home , the roles have changed . More women work full time as their husband . Do you remember how it was before W. II ? Women stayed at home taking care of their children . Do you think women are happy with this evolution . Probably yes , but it needs to be improved still .
Now. I have three potable devices , smartphone , iPad and notebook . I use communicating APP everyday because most of my friends can contact me without making a phone call . These devices give me access to social networking easily ,. I can see facebook and Linke. In and no need to be in front of computer . I send messages to friends make phone call via APP , the internet is so widespreading that shorten time to communicate , They can receive right away . I think it 's a double - edged sword because you have to be reached in short time , and people expect you to respond instantly . Although there are advantages and disadvantages , we can not deny that technology makes life more easier , also it bridge the gap between people live far away from each other . We should learn to control technology instead of being controlled .

In Uruguay there is an important difference between male and female genders considering all areas , but it may be the most important the salaries and positions for where there are considered when a company will hire someone . Who knows ? Maybe someday we will have gender equality . It is very interesting to see that in positions which could be as the core of the companies , it must be considering the same with both genders . In my country , it has been proved that the most important is not the gender . What is really necessary to evaluate is the emotional intelligence of a person . And paying attention to this topic , there was too many tests which proves , that it doesnot matter the gender , what 's really important is the attitude . It is clear that there is no possible to decide a general conclusion for this topic , but yes that is interesting to evaluate each particular case .

I like to go the movies and. I use to do it often . I use to have a time of fun with my wife or. I use to have a time of fun with my friends . Nevertheless and recently , a law against cellphones and video recorder devices within theater was published to forbid the people to stay with this devices running . In the case , this law forces that any device of this kind , should remains turned off until the movie theater presentation have ended , for example .. In my point of view , the law is extremly important to fight against the piracy and last but no least , to protect the country economy . I am hopeful that this law really can help the people of my country to go to the movies with no fear , because. I belive that no " crazy pirate " or somebody like it , can have the courage to stand against the law . Thank you .

I want to write about an extreme sport , that. I find exciting . It is climbing on mountains . Recently. I started climbing indoors in a climbing wall , but now. I am just a beginner . Although that this sport takes a lot of muscle force , it looks so much fun , especially in mountains where you can enjoy the fresh air and the panoramic view . What a feeling it must be when you reach the top of the mountain . So. I started to train meanwhile in a climbing wall to enhance my technique and strengthen my muscles . But on the other hand , rock climbing is so dangerous and actually. I am really afraid of all the things that could happen . I do not know if. I ever face my fears but. I really love challenging myself and to test my boundaries out . I think that is what rock climbing makes it so exciting . So. I am really looking forward to my climbing career and how my abilities are developing .

I had a long way to school . But on the way we met a lot of grown ups to speak with them .

I attended our weekly meeting yesterday . The boss was calm and peaceful this time . He spoke friendly with each one and tried to make understand the key points quickly . In the end he summarized all the subjects using compelling flow charts projected on the wall . One of these charts explained very well a procedure. I had never really understood in all these years . On the contrary ,. I hated explanation he gave about last week 's accident in our London 's headquarter . To be honest , his speech about what happened with the new payroll procedure made me completely furious . Anyway. I held my tongue . I would have liked if he had flown over this matter because he ruined the climate in the meeting room . Overall , some of us are not sure about boss amanagement now , and. I am worried we are going to become unproductive . It 's a shame because the first part of the meeting was very positive this time .
Today is my birthday . That 's always a occasion to verify my life travel . I have a good job and a good health .

I can do anything , second to be loved and love for my wife or girl but at the moment. I am not married or engaged For me life is a spiritual travel with joys and sorrows We have to do something that is different for each man but that permit to reach a superior level of awareness and to be a part of the whole universe .

Thomas is a great asset of the team . He works hard and smart . In the last three years , he brought  <num> millions worth projects to us and no one beat this record ! Clients told me that they like to work with Thomas who is knowledgeable and with great humours .

However , Thomas is a bit passive sometimes because he is always being Mr. Yes . He would help everything asked by colleagues even he does not want to . If we would like to promote him to a higher management level , then we should help him to be more assertive , so he can feel confident to say no or pass negative news to his colleagues .

I work in a hospital and no one is allowed to smoke there too , but my friend from Tunisia said that there are some hospitals that is not prohibited ! If you ask me ,. I will say we should see the patient side . What if he has asma ? What if it is a person who is alergic to some substances of the cigarette ? Besides , smoking can give you lung cancer and several diseases that makes you incapable of breathing normally . If. I may say , please , stop smoking . Not just because of the law , but it is good to your health .

Unhappy the women suffer discrimination actually . The most of companies remote the women pregnancy when they come to work after birth babies . This act provoke feeling of humiliating , discrimination and desconfort . The employer treats the women pregnant less favorably than a man because they take maternity leave .

That is a great injustice because we are capable as a men and sometimes we earn a less salary than them . This is a sexual discrimination .

Mr McDonald ,. I am writing regarding the conversation that we have already had last week . It 's about the overtime working times that. I worked on the last two weekends . How. I have already mentioned before , despite the fact that. I worked overtime , on the last to weekends , and indeed it is not the company 's fault , has nothing written in the contract stating that you are permitted to refuse paying my overtime working hours . Furthermore ,. I have had to ask for my lawyer suggestions concerning this case , consequently. I paid him some money even though. I am within my rights . Hence , instead of receiving only the extra payment regarding the overtime hours , now. I am asking for the total amount of money that. I have been paying and demanding in this process . Therefore ,. I recommend your company to resolve this case peacefully , making an agreement with me and my lawyer . In this way , we can avoid small claims court . Pedro
As part of my paternity responsibility. I am thinking to change my mortgage to a one that fits better to our personal finances , right now we are not being affected by the market but who knows if some day the bottom drop out of the market and the things become complicated to us , so we are being thrifty in our finances therefore we are changing our mortgage to a lower monthly payment . Also we need to expend less money in our daily expenses because they are too high and also our utilities bill are increasing every month , another expense it 's our gasoline expense it 's way too high because we have a six cylinder truck , so we will change it for a four cylinder model .
The author of the self - help book claims that its easy to change a career as he explains in his book . According to the author of the book , the average person is likely to change a career path five to seven times throughout their life time and this happen because more often than not , the first job we accept we more or less fall into because we are thrilled that someone wants to hire us . Looking at the author claims ,. I find that changing a career is one of the most difficult things a person can do because its something that you have learned and mastered during a period of time . I think before going toward any career path for the first time , a person should choose his career not just because someone wants to hire him , but because he likes it .
The English language plays a very important role in my life . English is not only the most spoken language in the world , it is always getting more and more important in the job , in schools and in everyday situations . There are two main aspects which. I want to point out why this language has such an essential part in my life . First of all , English has a major role during school and study . The second lanuage every pupil in Germany is been taught is English . You need good language skills because later in the study many coures are held in English . Students are required to make presentations in English . On this account every student must have a good vocabulary and speak fluently . Another aspect for the importance of English is the working environment which demands that every applicant speaks English in a fluent way . The process of globalisation has been increasing since many years . Employees have to talk to foreign colleagues or composing English reports . In my case. I have to speak regularly to people who are working in the UK . Therefore. I can draw my conclusion that English is a very important and necessary language .

The roles of men and women have changed a lot in the past <num> years in our country . She could be a soldier or software engineer , whereas he could be a stay - at - home dad or a nurse . Traditional values are changing . In the past , the husband was supposed to be the sole breadwinner , however , now the wife is also bring home the bacon or at least more bacon than her husband . What s driving the role reversal change ? I think education is one of the most important factors . The woman is better educated than the man in the past few years . However , gender equality is still a big issue in our society . According to the Statistics in <num> , men earned , on average , over <num> percent more than their female counterparts .

The city and the state. I live in does not really have a unique performing art . But in Bavaria , which is neighboring state , they really have a unique and as. I think very special kind of performing art . It is called ' Schuhplattler ' . The ' Schuhplattler ' is a folk dance performed by male dancers . The dancers wear the traditional costume of Bavaria , especially short leather trousers and alpine leg warmers ( so calles ' Wadelstrmpf ' ) or whatever one could call them . So , for my eyes , this really looks very funny , but of course it is a very serious performance . As. I said before , the dance is typical for Bavaria . In the perception of some people from outside Germany , Bavaria is typical for Germany . So therefore , at the end , you may say that ' Schuhplattler ' is also typical for Germany .
In Brazil , even in this day and age is very important to bring a small gift in a dinner party , as a bottle of wine , flowers or the dessert .

He said he had to leave us but he was confident , it would work very well with me . I was sitting at the back of the room . Everyone looked at me . I had to get up , walk across the room , reach the desk and eventually talk , but. I could not . It was just impossible . As. I looked up to them ,. I could hear the chairs rubbing the floor . They all were coming around me to support me ! Thanks to them . It helped me a lot !

Here , in my country , Brazil ,. I think we do not have to much gender differences , because at the work , a lot of women have importants positions at the company and get ting payed very well .

At the tv , whe have just male football leagues but curiously , the best femmale soccer player is Brazilian and her name is Marta . Some people ask me why mans do not play soccer with a girls and. I deffinatly do not know how to answer this question . Unfortunately , this is a habit of the Brazilian .

In today world to know English is almost a necessity . English is nowadays the most diffuse language in the world . In some field or sector English is the only reference language as for scientific articles , international meeting , trade and international business , etc . , also many English words are been introduced in some National languages as for example : business , movie , social network , media , news , etc .. I am a structural engineer and in my case to know , or at least understand , English is very important because the most important publications and technical books are written in English which is also the official language for meetings and international conferences . I think also to improve my job and to partecipate to important works abroad is mandatory to know English . In a globalized world , expecially in crisis time , the people and mainly the youngest should be able to adapt to every situations to grab good employment opportunities also abroad , the real advantage over another person is that of better to know English . We can say that to know English helps us to get better job opportunities , travel easily , acquire more knowledge and ultimately to make life more enjoyable .

Luckily. I have no financial problems at the moment . Being only nineteen and having moved out of my parents house just <num> months ago , it would be a pretty awful start into life if. I would  already have problems with stuff like mortgages and the struggles of the market . But. I am quite sure such problems will occur as soon as.

It ' s very unlikely to get problems with paying your bills if you only have to buy your food and a beer on saturday and do not even have to pay a rent like me . So , actually.

A couple of months ago. I decided to get a smartphone . I have always heard people talking about how technology has changed their lives , but. I did not really get it !

I live in Germany , exactly in Berlin . Other days. I visited a big hall in my town . I like to see Pink Floyd . We only managed to get seats in the back row . The performance was given by a very good band . The hall can be proud of its excellent acoustics . This performance ( The Wall ) really has some catching tunes . The audience was fascinated . The Wall is certainly one of the best Events of our time . Lately , some of the bandmates have been known to quarrel . I hope this rumor is wrong . One secret of success lies in ability to bridge the gap between serious and pop music . Thus the band reached abroad audience . He successfully markets the events in his life . Last year , he remixed some of his hit songs . Many record producers want to make contracts with him . It hard to stay on the top in the music business . It was a such a wonderful evening . I will always remember it .

Is gender equality still a hot topic in France ? You bet . There are many women in leading roles in business , art and politics . After the World War. II , women should stay at home to take care about children and home . Men should work hard and bring money home . Nowadays , things are rather differents . I mean " rather " because now women work like men but they earn not the same salary . Tought they work a lot like men . That 's why in France there still a little weird atmosphere about that problem because we have the feelings that this question never will resolve .

This film had a significantly different feel to it in comparison to the first , but it was equally as captivating and well executed . The attention to detail and consistency with the script play out are arguably the best. I have seen in a long while .

Have you ever wished you would  never got out your home in a common morning ? It may happen with anyone . Meg experienced her worst morning in a usual beautiful sunny day . After her breakfast she took part in a stunning scene . A young couple got out of a car and began vandalizing the local newsagents . When she tried to stop them , the young woman waved a gun and pushed it into her stomach . The woman with long hair talked so quickly and Meg could not understand her . She was terrified . The woman grabbed her laptop and ran off down the street . A nice guy that was passing , chased her and tried to catch the woman by the hair but it was a wig . At that moment they realize that she was not a woman , but a teenager boy . The vandals werenot caught yet and Meg is scared to leave the house . It 's believed that people are not safe even in a sunny day morning . There 's an element of truth to it !

You know , there are many options for you to treat your claustrophobia and keep working with all the people you like . For example ,.

It 's basically about facing a claustrophibic situation with a therapist next to you , to help you to calm down , until you realize that there 's no danger . You can learn how to deal with the symptoms as well , like panic atacks , anxiety or breathing problems , with breathing techniques and muscle relaxation . And of course , drugs might help . I really hope you give this subject more attention . Kind regards , Fulano .

Dear Mr. Jones , first at all ,. I would like to thank you for the wonderful conference that you led yesterday . Here are following my considerations concerning the presentation of the project that you have made . I have to admire the funny story that you told during the opening . Everybody felt comfortable and very motivated to listen to you . Another thing you did well was use visual aids , really useful to understand in depth the meaning of this project . I have to admire also the use of the charts : compelling and easy to understand . One thing you could have done differently was talk a little bit slower , because sometimes it was difficult cathcing all yours keypoints clearly . If you had also spent more time talking about the eventual big income consequent the achievment of this project , you would have obtained more financing from the investors . Overall , you did a great job , because you are a great speaker and your presentations are compelling . Sincerely Francesca Scorsese Francesca

They did not have the right for voting or being elected . But today they can even be prime minister of the country . And in <num> , governmet took a law into action that women will be applied positive discrimination which provides women privileges .

It is always a difficult task to learn a new language ... quite a challenge ! The process of learning implies many steps , pretty mandatory , and usually , a great amount of time . The student has to learn many words , and has to pronounce them correctly . This is a big problem because English is spoken very differently in all the great English speaking world . Anyway the process of learning new words is very time consuming and implies the effort to collect the new words using whatever trick the student knows . Some students write down long words lists , some others try to memorize the new words finding something that could link the new ones with the older ones . Sometimes the words are linked by their field of use ( you can think , for example , of the medical words or the legal language and so on ) , sometimes they share the same root and you can put together nouns , verbs , adjectives in this way .

Of course we should emphasize a model that works to teenage language to use in social network . Yours Sincerely .

A large luxurious house once full of life and light stood silent . Windows were closed and everything seemed dull grey . All servants gone . And here he was , a well - known oil tycoon at the age of <num> , lying. In the middle of his own cabinet , breathless , with a dagger in his chest .

In our day and age , it could also be an email or phone call . Do not wait too long , or it will be less meaningful to your host .
Hang gliding is a very beautiful sport , we can not deny . People flying back and forth , " painting " the sky with their colorful wings and becoming the blue sky more beautiful , it is awsome !

I must say difficult to understand . For me it is not just a matter of get over your fear heights , it is like face the death each time you do it ! Yes ,. I am not able to fly , but fortunately we have people that can get over their limits , fly over our heads and enjoy us with their wings of " liberty " , free of fear .

The smartphone Apple 4S was my dream from moment when my friend Marine bought such model of. IPhone . I had a phone , but not a " smart " one . At first ,. I was not sure about it , because it was so expensive . But one my friend was a sale consultant in the Apple store and he made me a good discount . I am not a tech expert and. I do not like tech innovation . I am very conservative and like more my old things , which connected with my memories . However ,. I have had the phone for a year now , and. I can honestly say it is overwhelming . I am afraid to become dependent on it . I try to use it only for keeping in touch text , phone and email with my relatives and friends and for accessing the internet . The biggest advantage is that the phone has a GPRS . It helps me in my trips . The downside of my phone is the battery , which can not work for a long time .

She showed the audience many visuals , some of them are actual photo about the building curtain wall . She also expressed a personal view about some technical code for building curtain wall . In her opinion , the government should not restrict the use of building curtain wall too much . One thing she did well was to let us know the importence of the design of building curtain wall . And some examples she delivered were so compelling too , it proved technique and art can perfect unifies in together . One thing she could have done better was to make the presentation more concise . Because it took us more than <num> hours , and by the end of the presentation , there were only 1/3 audience left ! Still ,. I think this presentation is useful for me , even if not all of it was. I never knew .
The appropriate career path . Its a fact that the majority of population are not satisfied with their career . Some of them are not satisfied with their wages , some of them are not satisfied with their career , or in many cases , they are unsatisfied with both , wage and career . This problem starts early , after high - school , when a teenager has to decide in which college he / she will study and follow a career . I think its a very difficult and important decision to take for a young person because usually we think that we must follow certain careers for the rest of our lives . When you are hired for the first time , changing careers becomes more difficult . I think the key point is trying to identify which jobs correspond with your personality , in order to be happy with the job . Once you have discovered some jobs that best suits to your personality , try to find on the. Internet some career tests that are available to the public for free .
The smartphone my wife gave me was a bit of a sorprise . I had a phone , but not a ' smart ' one . At first ,. I was not sure out about it. I thought it might be overhelming . I am certainly no tech expert . However ,. I have had the phone for a month now , and. I can honestly say. I do not know what. I would  do without it . I have dependent on it . I use it to keep in touch by text , phone and email with my family an friends ,. I am able to access the n. Iinternet when. I need news or information , and. I love to take pictures . One big advantage is that the phone has a built - in camera . I can take a picture and immediately send it to friends . Let me see- are there any downsides ? Well , maybe one :. I am having some kind of problem with the battery . It just does not last very long
Since. I was a kid ,. I have been practicing or trying to speak English . Begun at school when the other students and. I had English classes with grades and all . But. I can not say that it is my second language . First because. I was born in Brazil , so my mother language is Portuguese . Secondly , my mother is. Italian , so. I learned. Italian just hearing my mother and my grandparents speaking to each other . Then. I had to learn Spanish in school too , and sorry , Spanish is easier then English when you already speak latin languages , so. I have to admit that. I gave more atention to this other language at school . Well ,. I speak fluently <num> languages but it is not necessary for finding a job , for example , so. I now. I had to pay more attention to English and study hard . Harder than in school . Besides that ,. I am enjoying watching movies and television without subtitles and listening good music and understanding it . I love rock , so understand what Mick Jagger or John Lennon was saying is amazing !
My friend Meg went in the way to her job about <num> in the morning . She went into the Coffee Pot to buy a take - away coffee .

Suddenly , they began to vandalize a local newsagent , breaking the windows and throwing paint on the store front . My friend attempted to stop this behavier , but when she got close to woman , she showed her a gun and she pushed it in her stomach . Meanwhile , the vandal shouted some phrases about consumerism and evils of the modern world . After this , she grabbed my friend 's laptop and runned away . A passer - by chased her down and grabbed her hair , but it was a wig . The young woman was a teenage boy . My friend lived the most terrifying of her life !

Despite. I have no fear of height or water ,. I do not enjoy extreme sports so much ,. I am not a thrill - seeker person . My friend Marlise took up skydiving in <num> , so she always invited me to a skydiving training . She tells me " what a rush " and " You do not know what you are missing " . Anyway ,. I have never joined her . I would always regret that. I had not joined her , but in <num> she had a terrible accident , and broke a rib and had severe back problems for six months . Fortunatelly , she is all right now , after the accident she got a doughter and a son . But her history makes me fell that skydiving is dangerous ,. I just feel scared of it . The most extreme sport. I can imagine for myself is a helicopter tour or a boat tour around New York City , my favorite place .
